[//]: # "Documentation generated from docs/*.toml - DO NOT EDIT."

This document describes the WebServer settings of Node Config (TOML).

```toml
[WebServer]
AllowOrigins = 'http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:6688' # Default
BridgeCacheTTL = '0s' # Default
BridgeResponseURL = 'https://my-chainlink-node.example.com:6688' # Example
HTTPWriteTimeout = '10s' # Default
HTTPPort = 6688 # Default
SecureCookies = true # Default
SessionTimeout = '15m' # Default
SessionReaperExpiration = '240h' # Default
```

### AllowOrigins

```toml
AllowOrigins = 'http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:6688' # Default
```

AllowOrigins controls the URLs Chainlink nodes emit in the `Allow-Origins` header of its API responses. The setting can be a comma-separated list with no spaces. You might experience CORS issues if this is not set correctly.

You should set this to the external URL that you use to access the Chainlink UI.

You can set `AllowOrigins = '*'` to allow the UI to work from any URL, but it is recommended for security reasons to make it explicit instead.

### BridgeCacheTTL

```toml
BridgeCacheTTL = '0s' # Default
```

BridgeCacheTTL controls the cache TTL for all bridge tasks to use old values in newer observations in case of intermittent failure. It's disabled by default.

### BridgeResponseURL

```toml
BridgeResponseURL = 'https://my-chainlink-node.example.com:6688' # Example
```

BridgeResponseURL defines the URL for bridges to send a response to. This _must_ be set when using async external adapters.

Usually this will be the same as the URL/IP and port you use to connect to the Chainlink UI.

### HTTPWriteTimeout

⚠️ **_ADVANCED_**: _Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing._

```toml
HTTPWriteTimeout = '10s' # Default
```

HTTPWriteTimeout controls how long the Chainlink node's API server can hold a socket open for writing a response to an HTTP request. Sometimes, this must be increased for pprof.

### HTTPPort

```toml
HTTPPort = 6688 # Default
```

HTTPPort is the port used for the Chainlink Node API, CLI, and GUI.

### SecureCookies

```toml
SecureCookies = true # Default
```

SecureCookies requires the use of secure cookies for authentication. Set to false to enable standard HTTP requests along with `TLSPort = 0`.

### SessionTimeout

```toml
SessionTimeout = '15m' # Default
```

SessionTimeout determines the amount of idle time to elapse before session cookies expire. This signs out GUI users from their sessions.

### SessionReaperExpiration

```toml
SessionReaperExpiration = '240h' # Default
```

SessionReaperExpiration represents how long an API session lasts before expiring and requiring a new login.

## WebServer.RateLimit

```toml
[WebServer.RateLimit]
Authenticated = 1000 # Default
AuthenticatedPeriod = '1m' # Default
Unauthenticated = 5 # Default
UnauthenticatedPeriod = '20s' # Default
```

### Authenticated

```toml
Authenticated = 1000 # Default
```

Authenticated defines the threshold to which authenticated requests get limited. More than this many authenticated requests per `AuthenticatedRateLimitPeriod` will be rejected.

### AuthenticatedPeriod

```toml
AuthenticatedPeriod = '1m' # Default
```

AuthenticatedPeriod defines the period to which authenticated requests get limited.

### Unauthenticated

```toml
Unauthenticated = 5 # Default
```

Unauthenticated defines the threshold to which authenticated requests get limited. More than this many unauthenticated requests per `UnAuthenticatedRateLimitPeriod` will be rejected.

### UnauthenticatedPeriod

```toml
UnauthenticatedPeriod = '20s' # Default
```

UnauthenticatedPeriod defines the period to which unauthenticated requests get limited.

## WebServer.MFA

```toml
[WebServer.MFA]
RPID = 'localhost' # Example
RPOrigin = 'http://localhost:6688/' # Example
```

The Operator UI frontend supports enabling Multi Factor Authentication via Webauthn per account. When enabled, logging in will require the account password and a hardware or OS security key such as Yubikey. To enroll, log in to the operator UI and click the circle purple profile button at the top right and then click **Register MFA Token**. Tap your hardware security key or use the OS public key management feature to enroll a key. Next time you log in, this key will be required to authenticate.

### RPID

```toml
RPID = 'localhost' # Example
```

RPID is the FQDN of where the Operator UI is served. When serving locally, the value should be `localhost`.

### RPOrigin

```toml
RPOrigin = 'http://localhost:6688/' # Example
```

RPOrigin is the origin URL where WebAuthn requests initiate, including scheme and port. When serving locally, the value should be `http://localhost:6688/`.

## WebServer.TLS

```toml
[WebServer.TLS]
CertPath = '~/.cl/certs' # Example
Host = 'tls-host' # Example
KeyPath = '/home/$USER/.chainlink/tls/server.key' # Example
HTTPSPort = 6689 # Default
ForceRedirect = false # Default
```

The TLS settings apply only if you want to enable TLS security on your Chainlink node.

### CertPath

```toml
CertPath = '~/.cl/certs' # Example
```

CertPath is the location of the TLS certificate file.

### Host

```toml
Host = 'tls-host' # Example
```

Host is the hostname configured for TLS to be used by the Chainlink node. This is useful if you configured a domain name specific for your Chainlink node.

### KeyPath

```toml
KeyPath = '/home/$USER/.chainlink/tls/server.key' # Example
```

KeyPath is the location of the TLS private key file.

### HTTPSPort

```toml
HTTPSPort = 6689 # Default
```

HTTPSPort is the port used for HTTPS connections. Set this to `0` to disable HTTPS. Disabling HTTPS also relieves Chainlink nodes of the requirement for a TLS certificate.

### ForceRedirect

```toml
ForceRedirect = false # Default
```

ForceRedirect forces TLS redirect for unencrypted connections.
