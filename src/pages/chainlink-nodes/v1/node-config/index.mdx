[//]: # "Documentation generated from docs/*.toml - DO NOT EDIT."

This document describes the TOML format for configuration.

Also see the [Secrets Config](/chainlink-nodes/v1/secrets-config) page.

Other configuration options:<br/>
[EVM](/chainlink-nodes/v1/node-config/evm)<br/>
[Database](/chainlink-nodes/v1/node-config/database)<br/>
[WebServer](/chainlink-nodes/v1/node-config/web-server)<br/>
[Cosmos](/chainlink-nodes/v1/node-config/cosmos)<br/>
[Solana](/chainlink-nodes/v1/node-config/solana)<br/>

## Example

```toml
Log.Level = 'debug'

[[EVM]]
ChainID = '1' # Required

[[EVM.Nodes]]
Name = 'fake' # Required
WSURL = 'wss://foo.bar/ws'
HTTPURL = 'https://foo.bar' # Required
```

## Global

```toml
ExplorerURL = 'ws://explorer.url' # Example
InsecureFastScrypt = false # Default
RootDir = '~/.chainlink' # Default
ShutdownGracePeriod = '5s' # Default
```

### ExplorerURL

```toml
ExplorerURL = 'ws://explorer.url' # Example
```

ExplorerURL is the websocket URL used by the node to push stats. This variable is required to deliver telemetry.

### InsecureFastScrypt

⚠️ **_ADVANCED_**: _Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing._

```toml
InsecureFastScrypt = false # Default
```

InsecureFastScrypt causes all key stores to encrypt using "fast" scrypt params instead. This is insecure and only useful for local testing. DO NOT ENABLE THIS IN PRODUCTION.

### RootDir

```toml
RootDir = '~/.chainlink' # Default
```

RootDir is the Chainlink node's root directory. This is the default directory for logging, database backups, cookies, and other misc Chainlink node files. Chainlink nodes will always ensure this directory has 700 permissions because it might contain sensitive data.

### ShutdownGracePeriod

```toml
ShutdownGracePeriod = '5s' # Default
```

ShutdownGracePeriod is the maximum time allowed to shut down gracefully. If exceeded, the node will terminate immediately to avoid being SIGKILLed.

## Feature

```toml
[Feature]
FeedsManager = true # Default
LogPoller = false # Default
UICSAKeys = false # Default
```

### FeedsManager

```toml
FeedsManager = true # Default
```

FeedsManager enables the feeds manager service.

### LogPoller

```toml
LogPoller = false # Default
```

LogPoller enables the log poller, an experimental approach to processing logs, required if also using Evm.UseForwarders or OCR2.

### UICSAKeys

```toml
UICSAKeys = false # Default
```

UICSAKeys enables CSA Keys in the UI.

## TelemetryIngress

```toml
[TelemetryIngress]
UniConn = true # Default
Logging = false # Default
ServerPubKey = 'test-pub-key' # Example
URL = 'https://prom.test' # Example
BufferSize = 100 # Default
MaxBatchSize = 50 # Default
SendInterval = '500ms' # Default
SendTimeout = '10s' # Default
UseBatchSend = true # Default
```

### UniConn

```toml
UniConn = true # Default
```

UniConn toggles which ws connection style is used.

### Logging

```toml
Logging = false # Default
```

Logging toggles verbose logging of the raw telemetry messages being sent.

### ServerPubKey

```toml
ServerPubKey = 'test-pub-key' # Example
```

ServerPubKey is the public key of the telemetry server.

### URL

```toml
URL = 'https://prom.test' # Example
```

URL is where to send telemetry.

### BufferSize

```toml
BufferSize = 100 # Default
```

BufferSize is the number of telemetry messages to buffer before dropping new ones.

### MaxBatchSize

```toml
MaxBatchSize = 50 # Default
```

MaxBatchSize is the maximum number of messages to batch into one telemetry request.

### SendInterval

```toml
SendInterval = '500ms' # Default
```

SendInterval determines how often batched telemetry is sent to the ingress server.

### SendTimeout

```toml
SendTimeout = '10s' # Default
```

SendTimeout is the max duration to wait for the request to complete when sending batch telemetry.

### UseBatchSend

```toml
UseBatchSend = true # Default
```

UseBatchSend toggles sending telemetry to the ingress server using the batch client.

## AuditLogger

```toml
[AuditLogger]
Enabled = false # Default
ForwardToUrl = 'http://localhost:9898' # Example
JsonWrapperKey = 'event' # Example
Headers = ['Authorization: token', 'X-SomeOther-Header: value with spaces | and a bar+*'] # Example
```

### Enabled

```toml
Enabled = false # Default
```

Enabled determines if this logger should be configured at all

### ForwardToUrl

```toml
ForwardToUrl = 'http://localhost:9898' # Example
```

ForwardToUrl is where you want to forward logs to

### JsonWrapperKey

```toml
JsonWrapperKey = 'event' # Example
```

JsonWrapperKey if set wraps the map of data under another single key to make parsing easier

### Headers

```toml
Headers = ['Authorization: token', 'X-SomeOther-Header: value with spaces | and a bar+*'] # Example
```

Headers is the set of headers you wish to pass along with each request

## Log

```toml
[Log]
Level = 'info' # Default
JSONConsole = false # Default
UnixTS = false # Default
```

### Level

```toml
Level = 'info' # Default
```

Level determines both what is printed on the screen and what is written to the log file.

The available levels are:

- "debug": Useful for forensic debugging of issues.
- "info": High-level informational messages. (default)
- "warn": A mild error occurred that might require non-urgent action. Check these warnings semi-regularly to see if any of them require attention. These warnings usually happen due to factors outside of the control of the node operator. Examples: Unexpected responses from a remote API or misleading networking errors.
- "error": An unexpected error occurred during the regular operation of a well-maintained node. Node operators might need to take action to remedy this error. Check these regularly to see if any of them require attention. Examples: Use of deprecated configuration options or incorrectly configured settings that cause a job to fail.
- "crit": A critical error occurred. The node might be unable to function. Node operators should take immediate action to fix these errors. Examples: The node could not boot because a network socket could not be opened or the database became inaccessible.
- "panic": An exceptional error occurred that could not be handled. If the node is unresponsive, node operators should try to restart their nodes and notify the Chainlink team of a potential bug.
- "fatal": The node encountered an unrecoverable problem and had to exit.

### JSONConsole

```toml
JSONConsole = false # Default
```

JSONConsole enables JSON logging. Otherwise, the log is saved in a human-friendly console format.

### UnixTS

```toml
UnixTS = false # Default
```

UnixTS enables legacy unix timestamps.

Previous versions of Chainlink nodes wrote JSON logs with a unix timestamp. As of v1.1.0 and up, the default has changed to use ISO8601 timestamps for better readability.

## Log.File

```toml
[Log.File]
Dir = '/my/log/directory' # Example
MaxSize = '5120mb' # Default
MaxAgeDays = 0 # Default
MaxBackups = 1 # Default
```

### Dir

```toml
Dir = '/my/log/directory' # Example
```

Dir sets the log directory. By default, Chainlink nodes write log data to `$ROOT/log.jsonl`.

### MaxSize

```toml
MaxSize = '5120mb' # Default
```

MaxSize determines the log file's max size in megabytes before file rotation. Having this not set will disable logging to disk. If your disk doesn't have enough disk space, the logging will pause and the application will log errors until space is available again.

Values must have suffixes with a unit like: `5120mb` (5,120 megabytes). If no unit suffix is provided, the value defaults to `b` (bytes). The list of valid unit suffixes are:

- b (bytes)
- kb (kilobytes)
- mb (megabytes)
- gb (gigabytes)
- tb (terabytes)

### MaxAgeDays

```toml
MaxAgeDays = 0 # Default
```

MaxAgeDays determines the log file's max age in days before file rotation. Keeping this config with the default value will not remove log files based on age.

### MaxBackups

```toml
MaxBackups = 1 # Default
```

MaxBackups determines the maximum number of old log files to retain. Keeping this config with the default value retains all old log files. The `MaxAgeDays` variable can still cause them to get deleted.

## JobPipeline

```toml
[JobPipeline]
ExternalInitiatorsEnabled = false # Default
MaxRunDuration = '10m' # Default
MaxSuccessfulRuns = 10000 # Default
ReaperInterval = '1h' # Default
ReaperThreshold = '24h' # Default
ResultWriteQueueDepth = 100 # Default
```

### ExternalInitiatorsEnabled

```toml
ExternalInitiatorsEnabled = false # Default
```

ExternalInitiatorsEnabled enables the External Initiator feature. If disabled, `webhook` jobs can ONLY be initiated by a logged-in user. If enabled, `webhook` jobs can be initiated by a whitelisted external initiator.

### MaxRunDuration

```toml
MaxRunDuration = '10m' # Default
```

MaxRunDuration is the maximum time allowed for a single job run. If it takes longer, it will exit early and be marked errored. If set to zero, disables the time limit completely.

### MaxSuccessfulRuns

```toml
MaxSuccessfulRuns = 10000 # Default
```

MaxSuccessfulRuns caps the number of completed successful runs per pipeline
spec in the database. You can set it to zero as a performance optimisation;
this will avoid saving any successful run.

Note this is not a hard cap, it can drift slightly larger than this but not
by more than 5% or so.

### ReaperInterval

```toml
ReaperInterval = '1h' # Default
```

ReaperInterval controls how often the job pipeline reaper will run to delete completed jobs older than ReaperThreshold, in order to keep database size manageable.

Set to `0` to disable the periodic reaper.

### ReaperThreshold

```toml
ReaperThreshold = '24h' # Default
```

ReaperThreshold determines the age limit for job runs. Completed job runs older than this will be automatically purged from the database.

### ResultWriteQueueDepth

⚠️ **_ADVANCED_**: _Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing._

```toml
ResultWriteQueueDepth = 100 # Default
```

ResultWriteQueueDepth controls how many writes will be buffered before subsequent writes are dropped, for jobs that write results asynchronously for performance reasons, such as OCR.

## JobPipeline.HTTPRequest

```toml
[JobPipeline.HTTPRequest]
DefaultTimeout = '15s' # Default
MaxSize = '32768' # Default
```

### DefaultTimeout

```toml
DefaultTimeout = '15s' # Default
```

DefaultTimeout defines the default timeout for HTTP requests made by `http` and `bridge` adapters.

### MaxSize

```toml
MaxSize = '32768' # Default
```

MaxSize defines the maximum size for HTTP requests and responses made by `http` and `bridge` adapters.

## FluxMonitor

```toml
[FluxMonitor]
DefaultTransactionQueueDepth = 1 # Default
SimulateTransactions = false # Default
```

### DefaultTransactionQueueDepth

⚠️ **_ADVANCED_**: _Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing._

```toml
DefaultTransactionQueueDepth = 1 # Default
```

DefaultTransactionQueueDepth controls the queue size for `DropOldestStrategy` in Flux Monitor. Set to 0 to use `SendEvery` strategy instead.

### SimulateTransactions

```toml
SimulateTransactions = false # Default
```

SimulateTransactions enables transaction simulation for Flux Monitor.

## OCR2

```toml
[OCR2]
Enabled = false # Default
ContractConfirmations = 3 # Default
BlockchainTimeout = '20s' # Default
ContractPollInterval = '1m' # Default
ContractSubscribeInterval = '2m' # Default
ContractTransmitterTransmitTimeout = '10s' # Default
DatabaseTimeout = '10s' # Default
KeyBundleID = '7a5f66bbe6594259325bf2b4f5b1a9c900000000000000000000000000000000' # Example
CaptureEATelemetry = false # Default
```

### Enabled

```toml
Enabled = false # Default
```

Enabled enables OCR2 jobs.

### ContractConfirmations

```toml
ContractConfirmations = 3 # Default
```

ContractConfirmations is the number of block confirmations to wait for before enacting an on-chain
configuration change. This value doesn't need to be very high (in
particular, it does not need to protect against malicious re-orgs).
Since configuration changes create some overhead, and mini-reorgs
are fairly common, recommended values are between two and ten.

Malicious re-orgs are not any more of concern here than they are in
blockchain applications in general: Since nodes check the contract for the
latest config every ContractConfigTrackerPollInterval.Seconds(), they will
come to a common view of the current config within any interval longer than
that, as long as the latest setConfig transaction in the longest chain is
stable. They will thus be able to continue reporting after the poll
interval, unless an adversary is able to repeatedly re-org the transaction
out during every poll interval, which would amount to the capability to
censor any transaction.

Note that 1 confirmation implies that the transaction/event has been mined in one block.
0 confirmations would imply that the event would be recognised before it has even been mined, which is not currently supported.
e.g.
Current block height: 42
Changed in block height: 43
Contract config confirmations: 1
STILL PENDING

Current block height: 43
Changed in block height: 43
Contract config confirmations: 1
CONFIRMED

### BlockchainTimeout

```toml
BlockchainTimeout = '20s' # Default
```

BlockchainTimeout is the timeout for blockchain queries (mediated through
ContractConfigTracker and ContractTransmitter).
(This is necessary because an oracle's operations are serialized, so
blocking forever on a chain interaction would break the oracle.)

### ContractPollInterval

```toml
ContractPollInterval = '1m' # Default
```

ContractPollInterval is the polling interval at which ContractConfigTracker is queried for# updated on-chain configurations. Recommended values are between
fifteen seconds and two minutes.

### ContractSubscribeInterval

```toml
ContractSubscribeInterval = '2m' # Default
```

ContractSubscribeInterval is the interval at which we try to establish a subscription on ContractConfigTracker
if one doesn't exist. Recommended values are between two and five minutes.

### ContractTransmitterTransmitTimeout

```toml
ContractTransmitterTransmitTimeout = '10s' # Default
```

ContractTransmitterTransmitTimeout is the timeout for ContractTransmitter.Transmit calls.

### DatabaseTimeout

```toml
DatabaseTimeout = '10s' # Default
```

DatabaseTimeout is the timeout for database interactions.
(This is necessary because an oracle's operations are serialized, so
blocking forever on an observation would break the oracle.)

### KeyBundleID

```toml
KeyBundleID = '7a5f66bbe6594259325bf2b4f5b1a9c900000000000000000000000000000000' # Example
```

KeyBundleID is a sha256 hexadecimal hash identifier.

### CaptureEATelemetry

```toml
CaptureEATelemetry = false # Default
```

CaptureEATelemetry toggles collecting extra information from External Adaptares

## OCR

```toml
[OCR]
Enabled = false # Default
ObservationTimeout = '5s' # Default
BlockchainTimeout = '20s' # Default
ContractPollInterval = '1m' # Default
ContractSubscribeInterval = '2m' # Default
DefaultTransactionQueueDepth = 1 # Default
KeyBundleID = 'acdd42797a8b921b2910497badc5000600000000000000000000000000000000' # Example
SimulateTransactions = false # Default
TransmitterAddress = '0xa0788FC17B1dEe36f057c42B6F373A34B014687e' # Example
CaptureEATelemetry = false # Default
```

This section applies only if you are running off-chain reporting jobs.

### Enabled

```toml
Enabled = false # Default
```

Enabled enables OCR jobs.

### ObservationTimeout

```toml
ObservationTimeout = '5s' # Default
```

ObservationTimeout is the timeout for making observations using the DataSource.Observe method.
(This is necessary because an oracle's operations are serialized, so
blocking forever on an observation would break the oracle.)

### BlockchainTimeout

```toml
BlockchainTimeout = '20s' # Default
```

BlockchainTimeout is the timeout for blockchain queries (mediated through
ContractConfigTracker and ContractTransmitter).
(This is necessary because an oracle's operations are serialized, so
blocking forever on a chain interaction would break the oracle.)

### ContractPollInterval

```toml
ContractPollInterval = '1m' # Default
```

ContractPollInterval is the polling interval at which ContractConfigTracker is queried for
updated on-chain configurations. Recommended values are between
fifteen seconds and two minutes.

### ContractSubscribeInterval

```toml
ContractSubscribeInterval = '2m' # Default
```

ContractSubscribeInterval is the interval at which we try to establish a subscription on ContractConfigTracker
if one doesn't exist. Recommended values are between two and five minutes.

### DefaultTransactionQueueDepth

⚠️ **_ADVANCED_**: _Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing._

```toml
DefaultTransactionQueueDepth = 1 # Default
```

DefaultTransactionQueueDepth controls the queue size for `DropOldestStrategy` in OCR. Set to 0 to use `SendEvery` strategy instead.

### KeyBundleID

```toml
KeyBundleID = 'acdd42797a8b921b2910497badc5000600000000000000000000000000000000' # Example
```

KeyBundleID is the default key bundle ID to use for OCR jobs. If you have an OCR job that does not explicitly specify a key bundle ID, it will fall back to this value.

### SimulateTransactions

```toml
SimulateTransactions = false # Default
```

SimulateTransactions enables transaction simulation for OCR.

### TransmitterAddress

```toml
TransmitterAddress = '0xa0788FC17B1dEe36f057c42B6F373A34B014687e' # Example
```

TransmitterAddress is the default sending address to use for OCR. If you have an OCR job that does not explicitly specify a transmitter address, it will fall back to this value.

### CaptureEATelemetry

```toml
CaptureEATelemetry = false # Default
```

CaptureEATelemetry toggles collecting extra information from External Adaptares

## P2P

```toml
[P2P]
IncomingMessageBufferSize = 10 # Default
OutgoingMessageBufferSize = 10 # Default
PeerID = '12D3KooWMoejJznyDuEk5aX6GvbjaG12UzeornPCBNzMRqdwrFJw' # Example
TraceLogging = false # Default
```

P2P supports multiple networking stack versions. You may configure `[P2P.V1]`, `[P2P.V2]`, or both to run simultaneously.
If both are configured, then for each link with another peer, V2 networking will be preferred. If V2 does not work, the link will
automatically fall back to V1. If V2 starts working again later, it will automatically be preferred again. This is useful
for migrating networks without downtime. Note that the two networking stacks _must not_ be configured to bind to the same IP/port.

All nodes in the OCR network should share the same networking stack.

### IncomingMessageBufferSize

```toml
IncomingMessageBufferSize = 10 # Default
```

IncomingMessageBufferSize is the per-remote number of incoming
messages to buffer. Any additional messages received on top of those
already in the queue will be dropped.

### OutgoingMessageBufferSize

```toml
OutgoingMessageBufferSize = 10 # Default
```

OutgoingMessageBufferSize is the per-remote number of outgoing
messages to buffer. Any additional messages send on top of those
already in the queue will displace the oldest.
NOTE: OutgoingMessageBufferSize should be comfortably smaller than remote's
IncomingMessageBufferSize to give the remote enough space to process
them all in case we regained connection and now send a bunch at once

### PeerID

```toml
PeerID = '12D3KooWMoejJznyDuEk5aX6GvbjaG12UzeornPCBNzMRqdwrFJw' # Example
```

PeerID is the default peer ID to use for OCR jobs. If unspecified, uses the first available peer ID.

### TraceLogging

```toml
TraceLogging = false # Default
```

TraceLogging enables trace level logging.

## P2P.V1

```toml
[P2P.V1]
Enabled = true # Default
AnnounceIP = '1.2.3.4' # Example
AnnouncePort = 1337 # Example
BootstrapCheckInterval = '20s' # Default
DefaultBootstrapPeers = ['/dns4/example.com/tcp/1337/p2p/12D3KooWMHMRLQkgPbFSYHwD3NBuwtS1AmxhvKVUrcfyaGDASR4U', '/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/9999/p2p/12D3KooWLZ9uTC3MrvKfDpGju6RAQubiMDL7CuJcAgDRTYP7fh7R'] # Example
DHTAnnouncementCounterUserPrefix = 0 # Default
DHTLookupInterval = 10 # Default
ListenIP = '0.0.0.0' # Default
ListenPort = 1337 # Example
NewStreamTimeout = '10s' # Default
PeerstoreWriteInterval = '5m' # Default
```

### Enabled

```toml
Enabled = true # Default
```

Enabled enables P2P V1.

### AnnounceIP

```toml
AnnounceIP = '1.2.3.4' # Example
```

AnnounceIP should be set as the externally reachable IP address of the Chainlink node.

### AnnouncePort

```toml
AnnouncePort = 1337 # Example
```

AnnouncePort should be set as the externally reachable port of the Chainlink node.

### BootstrapCheckInterval

```toml
BootstrapCheckInterval = '20s' # Default
```

BootstrapCheckInterval is the interval at which nodes check connections to bootstrap nodes and reconnect if any of them is lost.
Setting this to a small value would allow newly joined bootstrap nodes to get more connectivity
more quickly, which helps to make bootstrap process faster. The cost of this operation is relatively
cheap. We set this to 1 minute during our test.

### DefaultBootstrapPeers

```toml
DefaultBootstrapPeers = ['/dns4/example.com/tcp/1337/p2p/12D3KooWMHMRLQkgPbFSYHwD3NBuwtS1AmxhvKVUrcfyaGDASR4U', '/ip4/1.2.3.4/tcp/9999/p2p/12D3KooWLZ9uTC3MrvKfDpGju6RAQubiMDL7CuJcAgDRTYP7fh7R'] # Example
```

DefaultBootstrapPeers is the default set of bootstrap peers.

### DHTAnnouncementCounterUserPrefix

```toml
DHTAnnouncementCounterUserPrefix = 0 # Default
```

DHTAnnouncementCounterUserPrefix can be used to restore the node's
ability to announce its IP/port on the P2P network after a database
rollback. Make sure to only increase this value, and _never_ decrease it.
Don't use this variable unless you really know what you're doing, since you
could semi-permanently exclude your node from the P2P network by
misconfiguring it.

### DHTLookupInterval

⚠️ **_ADVANCED_**: _Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing._

```toml
DHTLookupInterval = 10 # Default
```

DHTLookupInterval is the interval between which we do the expensive peer
lookup using DHT.

Every DHTLookupInterval failures to open a stream to a peer, we will
attempt to lookup its IP from DHT

### ListenIP

```toml
ListenIP = '0.0.0.0' # Default
```

ListenIP is the default IP address to bind to.

### ListenPort

```toml
ListenPort = 1337 # Example
```

ListenPort is the port to listen on. If left blank, the node randomly selects a different port each time it boots. It is highly recommended to set this to a static value to avoid network instability.

### NewStreamTimeout

⚠️ **_ADVANCED_**: _Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing._

```toml
NewStreamTimeout = '10s' # Default
```

NewStreamTimeout is the maximum length of time to wait to open a
stream before we give up.
We shouldn't hit this in practice since libp2p will give up fast if
it can't get a connection, but it is here anyway as a failsafe.
Set to 0 to disable any timeout on top of what libp2p gives us by default.

### PeerstoreWriteInterval

⚠️ **_ADVANCED_**: _Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing._

```toml
PeerstoreWriteInterval = '5m' # Default
```

PeerstoreWriteInterval controls how often the peerstore for the OCR V1 networking stack is persisted to the database.

## P2P.V2

```toml
[P2P.V2]
Enabled = false # Default
AnnounceAddresses = ['1.2.3.4:9999', '[a52d:0:a88:1274::abcd]:1337'] # Example
DefaultBootstrappers = ['12D3KooWMHMRLQkgPbFSYHwD3NBuwtS1AmxhvKVUrcfyaGDASR4U@1.2.3.4:9999', '12D3KooWM55u5Swtpw9r8aFLQHEtw7HR4t44GdNs654ej5gRs2Dh@example.com:1234'] # Example
DeltaDial = '15s' # Default
DeltaReconcile = '1m' # Default
ListenAddresses = ['1.2.3.4:9999', '[a52d:0:a88:1274::abcd]:1337'] # Example
```

### Enabled

```toml
Enabled = false # Default
```

Enabled enables P2P V2.
Note: V1.Enabled is true by default, so it must be set false in order to run V2 only.

### AnnounceAddresses

```toml
AnnounceAddresses = ['1.2.3.4:9999', '[a52d:0:a88:1274::abcd]:1337'] # Example
```

AnnounceAddresses is the addresses the peer will advertise on the network in `host:port` form as accepted by the TCP version of Go’s `net.Dial`.
The addresses should be reachable by other nodes on the network. When attempting to connect to another node,
a node will attempt to dial all of the other node’s AnnounceAddresses in round-robin fashion.

### DefaultBootstrappers

```toml
DefaultBootstrappers = ['12D3KooWMHMRLQkgPbFSYHwD3NBuwtS1AmxhvKVUrcfyaGDASR4U@1.2.3.4:9999', '12D3KooWM55u5Swtpw9r8aFLQHEtw7HR4t44GdNs654ej5gRs2Dh@example.com:1234'] # Example
```

DefaultBootstrappers is the default bootstrapper peers for libocr's v2 networking stack.

Oracle nodes typically only know each other’s PeerIDs, but not their hostnames, IP addresses, or ports.
DefaultBootstrappers are special nodes that help other nodes discover each other’s `AnnounceAddresses` so they can communicate.
Nodes continuously attempt to connect to bootstrappers configured in here. When a node wants to connect to another node
(which it knows only by PeerID, but not by address), it discovers the other node’s AnnounceAddresses from communications
received from its DefaultBootstrappers or other discovered nodes. To facilitate discovery,
nodes will regularly broadcast signed announcements containing their PeerID and AnnounceAddresses.

### DeltaDial

```toml
DeltaDial = '15s' # Default
```

DeltaDial controls how far apart Dial attempts are

### DeltaReconcile

```toml
DeltaReconcile = '1m' # Default
```

DeltaReconcile controls how often a Reconcile message is sent to every peer.

### ListenAddresses

```toml
ListenAddresses = ['1.2.3.4:9999', '[a52d:0:a88:1274::abcd]:1337'] # Example
```

ListenAddresses is the addresses the peer will listen to on the network in `host:port` form as accepted by `net.Listen()`,
but the host and port must be fully specified and cannot be empty. You can specify `0.0.0.0` (IPv4) or `::` (IPv6) to listen on all interfaces, but that is not recommended.

## Keeper

```toml
[Keeper]
DefaultTransactionQueueDepth = 1 # Default
GasPriceBufferPercent = 20 # Default
GasTipCapBufferPercent = 20 # Default
BaseFeeBufferPercent = 20 # Default
MaxGracePeriod = 100 # Default
TurnLookBack = 1_000 # Default
```

### DefaultTransactionQueueDepth

⚠️ **_ADVANCED_**: _Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing._

```toml
DefaultTransactionQueueDepth = 1 # Default
```

DefaultTransactionQueueDepth controls the queue size for `DropOldestStrategy` in Keeper. Set to 0 to use `SendEvery` strategy instead.

### GasPriceBufferPercent

⚠️ **_ADVANCED_**: _Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing._

```toml
GasPriceBufferPercent = 20 # Default
```

GasPriceBufferPercent specifies the percentage to add to the gas price used for checking whether to perform an upkeep. Only applies in legacy mode (EIP-1559 off).

### GasTipCapBufferPercent

⚠️ **_ADVANCED_**: _Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing._

```toml
GasTipCapBufferPercent = 20 # Default
```

GasTipCapBufferPercent specifies the percentage to add to the gas price used for checking whether to perform an upkeep. Only applies in EIP-1559 mode.

### BaseFeeBufferPercent

⚠️ **_ADVANCED_**: _Do not change this setting unless you know what you are doing._

```toml

The Chainlink node is equipped with an internal "nurse" service that can perform automatic `pprof` profiling when the certain resource thresholds are exceeded, such as memory and goroutine count. These profiles are saved to disk to facilitate fine-grained debugging of performance-related issues. In general, if you notice that your node has begun to accumulate profiles, forward them to the Chainlink team.

To learn more about these profiles, read the [Profiling Go programs with pprof](https://jvns.ca/blog/2017/09/24/profiling-go-with-pprof/) guide.
