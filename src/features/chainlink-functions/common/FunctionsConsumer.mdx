- To write a Chainlink Functions consumer contract, your contract must import [FunctionsClient.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/dev/0_0_0/FunctionsClient.sol). You can read the API reference: [FunctionsClient](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-client).

  This contract is not available in an NPM package, so you must download and import it from within your project.

  ```
  import {Functions, FunctionsClient} from "./dev/functions/FunctionsClient.sol";
  ```

- Use the [Functions.sol](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/develop/contracts/src/v0.8/functions/dev/0_0_0/Functions.sol) library to get all the functions needed for building a Chainlink Functions request. You can read the API reference: [Functions](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions).

  ```
  using Functions for Functions.Request;

  ```

- The latest request id, latest received response, and latest received error (if any) are defined as state variables. Note `latestResponse` and `latestError` are encoded as dynamically sized byte array `bytes`, so you will still need to decode them to read the response or error:

  ```
  bytes32 public latestRequestId;
  bytes public latestResponse;
  bytes public latestError;
  ```

- We define the `OCRResponse` event that your smart contract will emit during the callback

  ```
  event OCRResponse(bytes32 indexed requestId, bytes result, bytes err);
  ```

- Pass the oracle address for your network when you deploy the contract:

  ```
  constructor(address oracle) FunctionsClient(oracle)
  ```

- At any time, you can change the oracle address by calling the `updateOracleAddress` function.

- The two remaining functions are:

  - `executeRequest` for sending a request. It receives the JavaScript source code, encrypted secrets, list of arguments to pass to the source code, subscription id, and callback gas limit as parameters. Then:

    - It uses the `Functions`library to initialize the request and add any passed encrypted secrets or arguments. You can read the API Reference for [Initializing a request](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions/#initializerequest), [adding secrets](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions/#addinlinesecrets), and [adding arguments](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions/#addargs).

      ```
      Functions.Request memory req;
      req.initializeRequest(Functions.Location.Inline, Functions.CodeLanguage.JavaScript, source);
      if (secrets.length > 0) {
        req.addRemoteSecrets(secrets);
      }
      if (args.length > 0) req.addArgs(args);
      ```

    - It sends the request to the oracle by calling the `FunctionsClient` `sendRequest` function. You can read the API reference for [sending a request](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-client/#sendrequest). Finally, it stores the request id in `latestRequestId`.

      ```
      bytes32 assignedReqID = sendRequest(req, subscriptionId, gasLimit);
      latestRequestId = assignedReqID;
      ```

  - `fulfillRequest` to be invoked during the callback. This function is defined in `FunctionsClient` as `virtual` (read `fulfillRequest` [API reference](/chainlink-functions/api-reference/functions-client/#fulfillrequest)). So, your smart contract must override the function to implement the callback. The implementation of the callback is straightforward: the contract stores the latest response and error in `latestResponse` and `latestError` before emitting the `OCRResponse` event.

    ```
    latestResponse = response;
    latestError = err;
    emit OCRResponse(requestId, response, err);
    ```
