Chainlink NFT Floor Price Feeds provide a conservative and risk averse floor price estimate for an NFT collection. These feeds operate the same way as other Chainlink Data Feeds. NFT Floor Price Feeds are supported by [Coinbase Cloud's](https://www.coinbase.com/cloud/) aggregation algorithm and Chainlinkâ€™s oracle infrastructure to help eliminate extreme price outliers and make these feeds resistant to market manipulation. You can use NFT Floor Price Feeds for use cases that rely on high-quality NFT data, including lending and borrowing, on-chain derivatives, dynamic NFTs, gaming guilds, CeFi products, prediction markets, and more.

Find the list of testnet feeds on the [Contract Addresses](/data-feeds/nft-floor-price/addresses) page. To sign up for access to NFT Floor Price feeds on Ethereum Mainnet, [use this TypeForm](https://chainlinkcommunity.typeform.com/nft-price-feeds).

## Using NFT Floor Price Feeds

Read answers from NFT Floor Price Feeds the same way that you read other Data Feeds. Specify the [NFT Floor Price Feed Address](/data-feeds/nft-floor-price/addresses) that you want to read instead of specifying a Price Feed address. See the [Using Data Feeds](/data-feeds/using-data-feeds) page to learn more.

Using Solidity, your smart contract should reference [`AggregatorV3Interface`](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.8/interfaces/AggregatorV3Interface.sol), which defines the external functions implemented by Data Feeds.
