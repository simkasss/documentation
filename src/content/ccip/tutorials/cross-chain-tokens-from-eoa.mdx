In this tutorial, you will use Chainlink CCIP to transfer tokens directly from your [EOA (Externally Owned Account)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account) to an account on a different blockchain. First, you will pay for CCIP fees on the source blockchain using LINK. Then, you will run the same example paying for CCIP fees in native gas, such as ETH on Ethereum or MATIC on Polygon.

<Aside type="caution" title="Transferring tokens">
  This tutorial uses the term "transferring tokens" even though the tokens are not technically transferred. Instead,
  they are locked or burned on the source chain and then unlocked or minted on the destination chain. Read the [Token
  Pools](/ccip/architecture#token-pools) section to understand the various mechanisms that are used to transfer value
  across chains.

## Before you begin

1.  [Install Node.js 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Optionally, you can use the [nvm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nvm) to switch between Node.js versions with `nvm use 18`.

    ```shell
    node -v
    ```

    ```shell
    $ node -v
    v18.7.0
    ```

1.  Your [EOA (Externally Owned Account)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account) must have both ETH and LINK tokens on _Ethereum Sepolia_ to pay for the gas fees and CCIP fees.

    - [Configure MetaMask to use LINK tokens](/resources/acquire-link#configure-metamask-to-use-link-tokens)
    - Acquire testnet ETH and LINK from [faucets.chain.link](https://faucets.chain.link/sepolia)

1.  Check the [Supported Networks page](/ccip/supported-networks) to confirm that the tokens you will transfer are supported for your lane. In this example, you will transfer tokens from _Ethereum Sepolia_ to _Polygon Mumbai_ so check the list of supported tokens [here](/ccip/supported-networks#ethereum-sepolia--polygon-mumbai-lane).

1.  Learn how to [acquire CCIP test tokens](/ccip/test-tokens#mint-test-tokens). After following this guide, your [EOA (Externally Owned Account)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account) should have CCIP-BnM tokens, and CCIP-BnM should appear in the list of your tokens in MetaMask.

1.  In a terminal, clone the [smart-contract-examples repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples) and change to the `smart-contract-examples/ccip-offchain/javascript` directory.

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/smartcontractkit/smart-contract-examples.git && \
    cd smart-contract-examples/ccip-offchain/javascript
    ```

1.  Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

    ```shell
    npm install
    ```

1.  For higher security, the starter kit imports [@chainlink/env-enc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainlink/env-enc). Use this tool to encrypt your environment variables at rest.

    1.  Set an encryption password for your environment variables.

        ```shell
        npx env-enc set-pw
        ```

    1.  Run `npx env-enc set` to configure a `.env.enc` file with the basic variables that you need to send your requests to _Polygon Mumbai_.

        - `ETHEREUM_SEPOLIA_RPC_URL`: Set a URL for the _Ethereum Sepolia_ testnet. You can sign up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or another node provider service.

        - `POLYGON_MUMBAI_RPC_URL`: Set a URL for the _Polygon Mumbai_ testnet. You can sign up for a personal endpoint from [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/), [Infura](https://www.infura.io/), or another node provider service.

        - `PRIVATE_KEY`: Find the private key for your testnet wallet. If you use MetaMask, follow the instructions to [Export a Private Key](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289632-How-to-export-an-account-s-private-key).**Note**: The off-chain script uses your private key to sign any transactions you make such as transferring tokens.

        ```shell
        npx env-enc set
        ```

## Tutorial

### Transfer tokens and pay in LINK

In this example, you will transfer CCIP-BnM tokens from your EOA on _Ethereum Sepolia_ to an account on _Polygon Mumbai_. The destination account could be an [EOA (Externally Owned Account)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account) or a smart contract. The example shows how to transfer CCIP-BnM tokens, but you can re-use the same example to transfer other tokens as long as they are supported for your [lane](/ccip/concepts#lane).

For this example, CCIP fees are paid in LINK tokens. To learn how to pay CCIP fees in native ETH, read the [Pay in native](#transfer-tokens-and-pay-in-native) section. To see a detailed description of the example code, read the [code explanation](#code-explanation) section.

To transfer tokens and pay in LINK, use the following command:

```
node src/transfer-tokens.js sourceChain destinationChain destinationAccount tokenAddress amount feeTokenAddress
```

The `feeTokenAddress` parameter specifies the token address for paying CCIP fees. The supported tokens for paying fees include LINK, the native gas token of the source blockchain (ETH for Ethereum), and the wrapped native gas token (WETH for Ethereum).

Complete the following steps in your terminal:

1.  Send 1,000,000,000,000,000 (0.001 CCIP-BnM ) from your EOA on _Ethereum Sepolia_ to another account on _Polygon Mumbai_:

    ```
    node src/transfer-tokens.js ethereumSepolia polygonMumbai YOUR_ACCOUNT 0xFd57b4ddBf88a4e07fF4e34C487b99af2Fe82a05 1000000000000000 0x779877A7B0D9E8603169DdbD7836e478b4624789
    ```

        ```

1.  Analyze the logs:

    - The script communicates with the router to calculate the transaction fees required to transfer tokens, which amounts to 1,545,523,076,996,923 Juels (equivalent to 0,0015 LINK).
    - The script engages with the Link token contract, authorizing the router contract to spend 1,545,523,076,996,923 Juels for the fees and 1000000000000000 (0.001 CCIP-BnM) from your Externally Owned Account (EOA) balance.
    - The script initiates a transaction through the router to transfer 1000000000000000 (0.001 CCIP-BnM) to your account on _Polygon Mumbai_. It also returns the CCIP message ID.
    - The script continuously monitors the destination blockchain (_Polygon Mumbai_) to track the progress and completion of the cross-chain transaction.

1.  While the script is waiting for the cross-chain transaction to proceed, open the [CCIP explorer](https://ccip.chain.link/) and search your cross-chain transaction using the message ID. Notice that the status is _Waiting for finality_.

    />

1.  The data field is empty because only tokens are transferred. The gas limit is set to 0 because the transaction is directed to an Externally Owned Account (EOA). With an empty data field, no function calls on a smart contract are expected on the destination chain.

### Transfer tokens and pay in native

In this example, you will transfer CCIP-BnM tokens from your EOA on _Ethereum Sepolia_ to an account on _Polygon Mumbai_. The destination account could be an [EOA (Externally Owned Account)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/accounts/#types-of-account) or a smart contract. The example shows how to transfer LINK tokens, but you can re-use the same example to transfer other tokens as long as they are supported for your [lane](/ccip/concepts#lane).

For this example, CCIP fees are paid in Sepolia's native ETH. To learn how to pay CCIP fees in LINK, read the [Pay in LINK](#transfer-tokens-and-pay-in-link) section. To see a detailed description of the example code, read the [code explanation](#code-explanation) section.

To transfer tokens and pay in native, use the following command:

```
node src/transfer-tokens.js sourceChain destinationChain destinationAccount tokenAddress amount
```

Complete the following steps in your terminal:

1.  Send 1,000,000,000,000,000 (0.001 CCIP-BnM ) from your EOA on _Ethereum Sepolia_ to another account on _Polygon Mumbai_:

1.  The transaction time depends on the [finality of the source blockchain](/ccip/concepts#finality). After several minutes, the script will complete the polling process and the following logs will be displayed:

1.  The data field is empty because only tokens are transferred. The gas limit is set to 0 because the transaction is directed to an Externally Owned Account (EOA), so no function calls are expected on the destination chain.

## Code explanation

The Javascript featured in this tutorial is designed to interact with CCIP to transfer tokens. The contract code includes several code comments to clarify each step, but this section explains the key elements.

### Imports

The script starts by importing the necessary modules and data. It imports ethers.js and ABIs (Application Binary Interface) from a config file for different contracts and configurations.

### Handling arguments

The `handleArguments` function validates and parses the command line arguments passed to the script.

### Main function: transferTokens

This asynchronous function, `transferTokens` performs the token transfer.

#### Initialization

The script initializes ethers providers to communicate with the blockchains in this section. It parses source and destination router addresses and blockchain selectors. A signer is created to sign transactions.

#### Token validity check

The script fetches a list of supported tokens for the destination chain and checks if the token you want to transfer is supported.

#### Building the CCIP message

A Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol (CCIP) message is built, which will be sent to the router contract. It includes the destination account, amount, token address, and additional parameters.

#### Fee calculation

The script calls the router to estimate the fees for transferring tokens.

#### Transferring tokens

This section handles the actual transferring of tokens. It covers three cases:

    - **Fees paid using the native gas token:** The contract makes one approval for the transfer amount. The fees are included in the `value` transaction field.
    - **Fees paid using an asset different from the native gas token and the token being transferred:** The contracts makes two approvals. The first approval is for the transfer amount and the second approval is for the fees.
    - **Fees paid using the same asset that is being transferred, but not the native gas token:** The contract makes a single approval for the sum of the transfer amount and fees.

The script waits for the transaction to be validated and stores the transaction receipt.

#### Fetching message ID

The router's `ccipSend` function returns a message ID. The script simulates a call to the blockchain to fetch the message ID that the router returned.

#### Checking the status on the destination chain

The script polls the off-ramp contracts on the destination chain to wait for the message to be executed. If the message is executed, it returns the status. Otherwise, the message times out after 40 minutes.
