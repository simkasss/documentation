You can find a list of release notes for Chainlink nodes in the [smartcontractkit GitHub repository](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases). Docker images are available in the [Chainlink Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/smartcontract/chainlink/tags).

## Changes in v2.3.0 nodes

**[v2.3.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v2.3.0)**

### Added

- Add a new field called `Order` (range from 1 to 100) to `EVM.Nodes` that is used for the `PriorityLevel` node selector and also as a tie-breaker for `HighestHead` and `TotalDifficulty`. `Order` levels are considered in ascending order. If not defined it will default to `Order = 100` (last level).
- Added new node selection mode called `PriorityLevel` for EVM, it is a tiered round-robin in ascending order of the`Order` field. Example:

  ```
  [EVM.NodePool]
  SelectionMode = 'PriorityLevel'

  [[EVM.Nodes]]
  Name = '...'
  WSURL = '...'
  HTTPURL = '...'
  Order = 5
  ```

- The config keys `WebServer.StartTimeout` and `WebServer.HTTPMaxSize`. These keys respectively set a timeout for the node server to
  start and set the max request size for HTTP requests. Previously these attributes were set by
  `JobPipeline.DefaultHTTPLimit`/`JobPipeline.DefaultHTTPTimeout`. To migrate to these new fields, set their values to be identical to
  `JobPipeline.DefaultHTTPLimit`/`JobPipeline.DefaultHTTPTimeout`.
- Low latency oracle jobs now support in-protocol block range guarantees. This
  is necessary in order to produce reports with block number ranges that do not
  overlap. It can now be guaranteed at the protocol level, so we can use local
  state instead of relying on an unreliable round-trip to the Mercury server.
- New settings `Evm.GasEstimator.LimitJobType.OCR2`, `OCR2.DefaultTransactionQueueDepth`, `OCR2.SimulateTransactions` for OCR2
  jobs. These replace the settings `Evm.GasEstimator.LimitJobType.OCR`, `OCR.DefaultTransactionQueueDepth`, and `OCR.SimulateTransactions`
  for OCR2.
- Add new config parameter to OCR and OCR2 named `TraceLogging` that enables trace logging of OCR and OCR2 jobs, previously this behavior was controlled from the `P2P.TraceLogging` parameter. To maintain the same behavior set `OCR.TraceLogging` and `OCR2.TraceLogging` to the same value `P2P.TraceLogging` was set.
- Add two new config parameters `WebServer.ListenIP` and `WebServer.TLS.ListenIP` which allows binding Chainlink HTTP/HTTPS servers to a particular IP. The default is '0.0.0.0' which listens to all IP addresses (same behavior as before). Set to '127.0.0.1' to only allow connections from the local machine (this can be handy for local development).
- Add several new metrics for mercury feeds, related to WSRPC connections:
  - `mercury_transmit_timeout_count`
  - `mercury_dial_count`
  - `mercury_dial_success_count`
  - `mercury_dial_error_count`
  - `mercury_connection_reset_count`

Node operators may wish to add alerting based around these metrics.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug in the `nodes xxx list` command that caused results to not be displayed correctly

### Changed

- Assumption violations for MaxFeePerGas >= BaseFeePerGas and MaxFeePerGas >= MaxPriorityFeePerGas in EIP-1559 effective gas price calculation will now use a gas price if specified
- Config validation now enforces protection against duplicate chain ids and node fields per provided TOML file. Duplicates accross multiple configuration files are still valid. If you have specified duplicate chain ids or nodes in a given configuration file, this change will error out of all `node` subcommands.
- Restricted scope of the `Evm.GasEstimator.LimitJobType.OCR`, `OCR.DefaultTransactionQueueDepth`, and `OCR.SimulateTransactions` settings so they
  apply only to OCR. Previously these settings would apply to OCR2 as well as OCR. You must use the OCR2 equivalents added above if you
  want your settings to apply to OCR2.

### Removed

- Legacy chain types Optimism and Optimism2. OptimismBedrock is now used to handle Optimism's special cases.
- Optimism Kovan configurations along with legacy error messages.

## Changes in v2.2.0 nodes

**[v2.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v2.2.0)**

### Added

- Added experimental support of runtime process isolation for Solana data feeds. This requires plugin binaries to be installed and
  configured using the `CL_SOLANA_CMD` and `CL_MEDIAN_CMD` environment variables. See the [plugins/README.md](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/v2.2.0/plugins/README.md) for more information.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug which made it impossible to re-send the same transaction after abandoning it while manually changing the nonce.

### Changed

- Set the default for `EVM.GasEstimator.BumpTxDepth` to `EVM.Transactions.MaxInFlight`.
- Bumped batch size defaults for EVM-specific configurations. If you are overriding any of these fields in your local config, consider if it is necessary:
  - `LogBackfillBatchSize = 1000`
  - `RPCDefaultBatchSize = 250`
  - `GasEstimator.BatchSize = 25`
- Dropped support for the Development Mode configuration. The `CL_DEV` environment variable is now ignored on production builds.
- Updated the Docker image's PostgreSQL client (used for backups) to v15 in order to support PostgreSQL v15 servers.

## Changes in v2.1.0 nodes

**[v2.1.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v2.1.0)**

- The `chainlink db` CLI commands now validate the TOML configuration and secrets before executing. These commands will report errors
  if any database-specific configuration is invalid.

## Changes in v2.0.0 nodes

**[v2.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v2.0.0)**

### Added

- Add OCR2 Plugin selection for FMS
- Added kebab case aliases for the following flags:
  - `evm-chain-id` alias for `evmChainID` in commands: `chainlink blocks replay`, `chainlink forwarders track`, `chainlink keys ... chain`
  - `old-password` alias for `oldpassword` in commands: `chainlink keys ... import`
  - `new-password` alias for `newpassword` in commands: `chainlink keys ... export`
  - `new-role` alias for `newrole` in commands: `admin users chrole`
  - `set-next-nonce` alias for `setNextNonce` in commands: `chainlink keys ... chain`

### Changed

- TOML configuration and secrets are now scoped to `chainlink node` command rather than being global flags.
- TOML configuration validation has been moved from `chainlink config validate` to `chainlink node validate`.
- Move `chainlink node {status,profile}` to `chainlink admin {status,profile}`.

### Removed

- Configuration with legacy environment variables is no longer supported. TOML is required.

## Changes in v1.13.0 nodes

**[v1.13.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.13.0)**

### TOML Configuration

TOML configuration for Chainlink nodes is stable and recommended for mainnet deployments. TOML configuration will be the only supported configuration method starting with `v2.0.0`. Enable TOML configuration by specifying the `-config <filename>.toml` flag with the path to your TOML file. Alternatively, you can specify the raw TOML config in the [`CL_CONFIG` environment variable](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration#cl_config). See the [CONFIG.md](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/v1.13.0/docs/CONFIG.md) and [SECRETS.md](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/v1.13.0/docs/SECRETS.md) on GitHub to learn more.

### Added

- Added support for sending OCR2 job specs to the Feeds Manager.
- Log poller filters are now saved in the database and restored on node startup to guard against missing logs during periods where services are temporarily unable to start.

### Updated

- TOML config: The environment variable `CL_CONFIG` is always processed as the last configuration. This has the effect of being the final override
  for any values provided via configuration files.

### Changed

- The Feeds Manager is now enabled by default.

### Removed

- Terra is no longer supported.

## Changes in v1.12.0 nodes

**[v1.12.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.12.0)**

### Added

- Prometheus gauge `mailbox_load_percent` for percent of "`Mailbox`" capacity used.
- New config option `JobPipeline.MaxSuccessfulRuns` caps the total number of saved completed runs per job. This is done in response to the `pipeline_runs` table potentially becoming large, which can cause performance degradation. The default is set to 10,000. You can set it to 0 to disable run saving entirely. **NOTE**: This can only be configured via TOML and not with an environment variable.
- Prometheus gauge vector `feeds_job_proposal_count` to track counts of job proposals partitioned by proposal status.
- Support for variable expression for the `minConfirmations` parameter on the `ethtx` task.

### Updated

- Removed the `KEEPER_TURN_FLAG_ENABLED` as all networks and nodes have switched this to `true`. The variable should be completely removed.
- Removed the `Keeper.UpkeepCheckGasPriceEnabled` config and the `KEEPER_CHECK_UPKEEP_GAS_PRICE_FEATURE_ENABLED` environment variable. This feature is deprecated and the variable should be completely removed.

### Fixed

- Fixed (SQLSTATE 42P18) error on Job Runs page, when attempting to view specific older or infrequenty run jobs.
- The `config dump` subcommand was fixed to dump the correct config data. The P2P.V1.Enabled config logic incorrectly matched V2, by only setting explicit true values so that otherwise the default is used. The V1.Enabled default value is actually true already, and is now updated to only set explicit false values.

## Changes in v1.11.0 nodes

**[v1.11.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.11.0)**

### Added

- Added a new mode for the [`NODE_SELECTION_MODE` environment variable](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration#node_selection_mode). Use `TotalDifficulty` to select the node with the greatest total difficulty.
- Added the [`NODE_SYNC_THRESHOLD` environment variable](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration#node_sync_threshold) to ensure that live nodes do not lag too far behind.
- Added the [`BRIDGE_CACHE_TTL` environment variable](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration#bridge_cache_ttl) which caches bridge responses for a specified amount of time.
- Add the prometheus metrics labelled by bridge name for monitoring external adapter queries. The following metrics are included:
  - `bridge_latency_seconds`
  - `bridge_errors_total`
  - `bridge_cache_hits_total`
  - `bridge_cache_errors_total`
- ⚠️ Experimental: ⚠️ Added static configuration using TOML files as an alternative to the existing combination of environment variables and persisted database configurations. For this release, use TOML for configuration only on test networks. In the future with `v2.0.0`, TOML configuration will become the only supported configuration method. Enable TOML configuration by specifying the `-config <filename>.toml` flag with the path to your TOML file. Alternatively, you can specify the raw TOML config in the [`CL_CONFIG` environment variable](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration#cl_config). See the [CONFIG.md](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/v1.12.0/docs/CONFIG.md) and [SECRETS.md](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/v1.12.0/docs/SECRETS.md) on GitHub to learn more.

### Fixed

- Fixed a minor bug where Chainlink would not always resend all pending transactions when using multiple keys.

### Updated

- `NODE_NO_NEW_HEADS_THRESHOLD=0` no longer requires `NODE_SELECTION_MODE=RoundRobin`.

## Changes in v1.10.0 nodes

**[v1.10.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.10.0)**

### Added

- Added an optional external logger `AUDIT_LOGS_FORWARDER_URL`: When set, this environment variable configures and enables an optional HTTP logger which is used specifically to send audit log events. Configure this logger with the following environment variables:
  - [AUDIT_LOGGER_FORWARD_TO_URL](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration#audit_logger_forward_to_url)
  - [AUDIT_LOGGER_HEADERS](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration#audit_logger_headers)
  - [AUDIT_LOGGER_JSON_WRAPPER_KEY](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration#audit_logger_json_wrapper_key)
- Added [automatic connectivity detection](#automatic-connectivity-detection) to automatically detect if there is a transaction propagation/connectivity issue and prevent bumping in these cases on EVM chains.

### Changed

- The default maximum gas price on most networks is now effectively unlimited.
  - Chainlink will bump as high as necessary to get a transaction included. [Automatic connectivity detection](#automatic-connectivity-detection) prevents excessive bumping when there is a connectivity failure.
  - If you want to change this, manually set the [`ETH_MAX_GAS_PRICE_WEI` environment variable](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#eth_max_gas_price_wei).
- If the `EVMChainID` is not set explicitly in the job spec for a new OCR job, the field is now automatically added with a default chain ID.
  - Old OCR jobs missing `EVMChainID` continue to run on any chain that the [`ETH_CHAIN_ID` variable](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#eth_chain_id) is set to (or the first chain if it is not set). This can be changed after a restart.
  - Newly created OCR jobs run only on a single fixed chain and are unaffected by changes to `ETH_CHAIN_ID` after the job is added.
  - It should no longer be possible to end up with multiple OCR jobs for a single contract running on the same chain. Only one job per contract per chain is allowed.
  - If there are any existing duplicate jobs per contract and per chain, all but the jobs with the latest creation date will be pruned during the upgrade.

### Fixed

- Fixed minor bug where Chainlink would attempt and fail to estimate a tip cap higher than the maximum configured gas price in EIP1559 mode. It now caps the tipcap to the max instead of erroring.
- Fixed a bug where it was impossible to remove ETH keys that had extant transactions. Now, removing an ETH key will drop all associated data automatically, including past transactions.

### Automatic connectivity detection

Chainlink will no longer bump excessively if the network is broken.

This feature only applies on EVM chains when using BlockHistoryEstimator (the most common case).
Chainlink will now try to automatically detect if there is a transaction propagation/connectivity issue and prevent bumping in these cases. This can help avoid the situation where RPC nodes are not propagating transactions for some reason (e.g., go-ethereum bug, networking issue ...etc) and Chainlink responds in a suboptimal way by bumping transactions to a very high price in an effort to get them mined. This can lead to unnecessary expense when the connectivity issue is resolved and the transactions are finally propagated into the mempool.

This feature is enabled by default with fairly conservative settings: if a transaction has been priced above the 90th percentile of the past 12 blocks, but still wants to bump due to not being mined, a connectivity/propagation issue is assumed and all further bumping will be prevented for this transaction. In this situation, Chainlink will start firing the `block_history_estimator_connectivity_failure_count` prometheus counter and logging at critical level until the transaction is mined.

The default settings should work fine for most users. For advanced users, the values can be tweaked by changing `BLOCK_HISTORY_ESTIMATOR_CHECK_INCLUSION_BLOCKS` and `BLOCK_HISTORY_ESTIMATOR_CHECK_INCLUSION_PERCENTILE`.

To disable connectivity checking completely, set `BLOCK_HISTORY_ESTIMATOR_CHECK_INCLUSION_BLOCKS=0`.

## Changes in v1.9.0 nodes

**[v1.9.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.9.0)**

- Added the [`length` task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#length-task) and the [`lessthan` task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#less-than-task) for jobs.
- Added the `gasUnlimited` parameter to the [`ethcall` task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#eth-call-task).
- The **Keys** page in Operator UI includes several admin commands that were previously available only by using the `keys eth chain` commands:
  - Ability to abandon all current transactions: This is the same as the `abandon` CLI command. Previously it was necessary to edit the database directly to abandon transactions. This command makes it easier to resolve issues that require transactions to be abandoned.
  - Ability to enable/disable a key for a specific chain: This allows you to control keys on a per-chain basis.
  - Ability to manually set the nonce for a key. This gives you a way to set the next nonce for a specific key in the UI, which can be useful for debugging.

## Changes in v1.8.1 nodes

**[v1.8.1 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.8.1)**

- Added several improvements for Arbitrum Nitro including a multi-dimensional gas model, with dynamic gas pricing and limits.
  - The new default estimator for Arbitrum networks uses the suggested gas price up to `ETH_MAX_GAS_PRICE_WEI` with a 1000 gwei default value and an estimated gas limit up to `ETH_GAS_LIMIT_MAX` with a 1,000,000,000 default.
  - Remove the `GAS_ESTIMATOR_MODE` environment variable to use the new defaults.
- `ETH_GAS_LIMIT_MAX` to puts a maximum on the gas limit returned by the Arbitrum estimator.

## Changes in v1.8.0 nodes

**[v1.8.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.8.0)**

### Added

- Added the `hexencode` and `base64encode` tasks (pipeline). See the [Hex Encode Task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#hex-encode-task) and [Base64 Encode Task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#base64-encode-task) pages for examples.
- `forwardingAllowed` per job attribute to allow forwarding txs submitted by the job.
- Added `Arbitrum Goerli` configuration support.
- Added the [`NODE_SELECTION_MODE` (`EVM.NodePool.SelectionMode`) environment variable](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#node_selection_mode), which controls node picking strategy. Supported values are:
  - `HighestHead` is the default mode, which picks a node that has the highest reported head number among other alive nodes. When several nodes have the same latest head number, the strategy sticks to the last used node. This mode requires `NODE_NO_NEW_HEADS_THRESHOLD` to be configured, otherwise it will always use the first alive node.
  - `RoundRobin` mode iterates among available alive nodes. This was the default behavior prior to this release.
- New `evm keys chain` command. This can also be accessed at `/v2/keys/evm/chain`. This command has the following uses:
  - Manually set or reset a nonce: `chainlink evm keys chain --address "0xEXAMPLE" --evmChainID 99 --setNextNonce 42`
  - Enable a key for a particular chain: `chainlink evm keys chain --address "0xEXAMPLE" --evmChainID 99 --setEnabled true`
  - Disable a key for a particular chain: `chainlink evm keys chain --address "0xEXAMPLE" --evmChainID 99 --setEnabled false`
- It is now possible to use the same key across multiple chains.

### Changed

- The `chainlink admin users update` command is replaced with `chainlink admin users chrole`. Only the role can be changed for a user.
- Keypath now supports paths with any depth, instead of limiting it to 2.
- `Arbitrum` chains are no longer restricted to only `FixedPrice` `GAS_ESTIMATOR_MODE`.
- Updated `Arbitrum Rinkeby & Mainnet` configurations for Nitro.

### Removed

- The `setnextnonce` local client command is removed and is replaced by the more general `evm keys chain` command client command.

## Changes in v1.7.1 nodes

**[v1.7.1 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.7.1)**

### Fixed

- Arbitrum Nitro client error support

## Changes in v1.7.0 nodes

**[v1.7.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.7.0)**

### Added

- `p2pv2Bootstrappers` is added as a new optional property of OCR1 job specs. The default can still be specified with the [`P2PV2_BOOTSTRAPPERS` environment variable](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#p2pv2_bootstrappers).

- Added official support for the [Sepolia testnet](https://sepolia.dev) on Chainlink nodes.

- Added [`hexdecode` task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#hex-decode-task) and the [`base64decode` task](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/all-tasks/#base64-decode-task) (pipeline).

- Added support for the Besu execution client. Although Chainlink supports Besu, Besu itself has several issues that can make it unreliable. For additional context, see the following issues:

  - [hyperledger/besu/issues/4212](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/4212)
  - [hyperledger/besu/issues/4192](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/4192)
  - [hyperledger/besu/issues/4114](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/issues/4114)

- Added [Multi-user and Role Based Access Control](/chainlink-nodes/resources/miscellaneous/#multi-user-and-role-based-access-control-rbac) functionality. This allows the root admin CLI user and additional admin users to create and assign tiers of role-based access to new users. These new API users are able to log in to the Operator UI independently and can each have specific roles tied to their account. There are four roles: `admin`, `edit`, `run`, and `view`.

  - User management can be configured through the use of the new admin CLI command `chainlink admin users`. Be sure to run `chainlink admin login`. For example, a readonly user can be created with: `chainlink admin users create --email=operator-ui-read-only@test.com --role=view`.
  - Updated documentation repo with a break down of actions to required role level

- Added gas limit control for individual job specs and individual job types. The following rule of precedence is applied:

  1. The task-specific parameter `gasLimit` overrides anything else when specified. For example, the `ethtx` task has a `gasLimit` parameter that overrides the other defaults for this specific task.
  1. The job-spec attribute `gasLimit` applies only to a specific job spec.
  1. The job-type limits affect any jobs of the corresponding type. The following environment variables are available:

     - [ETH_GAS_LIMIT_OCR_JOB_TYPE](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#eth_gas_limit_ocr_job_type)
     - [ETH_GAS_LIMIT_DR_JOB_TYPE](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#eth_gas_limit_dr_job_type)
     - [ETH_GAS_LIMIT_VRF_JOB_TYPE](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#eth_gas_limit_vrf_job_type)
     - [ETH_GAS_LIMIT_FM_JOB_TYPE](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#eth_gas_limit_fm_job_type)
     - [ETH_GAS_LIMIT_KEEPER_JOB_TYPE](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#eth_gas_limit_keeper_job_type)

  1. The global `ETH_GAS_LIMIT_DEFAULT` (`EVM.GasEstimator.LimitDefault`) value is used only when the preceding rules are not set.

### Fixed

- Addressed a very rare bug where using multiple nodes with differently configured RPC tx fee caps could cause missed transactions. Ensure that your RPC nodes have no caps. For more information, see the [performance and tuning guide](/chainlink-nodes/resources/evm-performance-configuration).
- Improved handling of unknown transaction error types to make Chainlink more robust in certain cases on unsupported chains or RPC clients.

## Changes in v1.6.0 nodes

**[v1.6.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.6.0)**

- Simplified password complexity requirements. All passwords used with Chainlink must meet the following requirements:
  - Must be 16 characters or more
  - Must not contain leading or trailing whitespace
  - User passwords must not contain the user's API email
- Simplified the Keepers job spec by removing the observation source from the required parameters.

## Changes in v1.5.0 nodes

**[v1.5.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.5.0)**

- Chainlink will not boot if the Postgres database password is missing or insecure. Passwords must conform to the following rules:

  - Must be longer than 12 characters
  - Must comprise at least 3 of the following items:
    - Lowercase characters
    - Uppercase characters
    - Numbers
    - Symbols
  - Must not comprise:
    - More than three identical consecutive characters
    - Leading or trailing whitespace (note that a trailing newline in the password file, if present, will be ignored)

  For backward compatibility, you can bypass this check at your own risk by setting `SKIP_DATABASE_PASSWORD_COMPLEXITY_CHECK=true`.

- The following environment variables are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. They are are replaced by the following command line arguments:

  - `INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY`: Replaced by the `--insecure-skip-verify` CLI argument
  - `CLIENT_NODE_URL`: Replaced by the `--remote-node-url URL` CLI argument
  - `ADMIN_CREDENTIALS_FILE`: Replaced by the `--admin-credentials-file FILE` CLI argument

  Run `./chainlink --help` to learn more about these CLI arguments.

- The `Optimism2` `GAS_ESTIMATOR_MODE` has been renamed to `L2Suggested`. The old name is still supported for now.

- The `p2pBootstrapPeers` property on OCR2 job specs has been renamed to `p2pv2Bootstrappers`.

### Added

- Added the [`ETH_USE_FORWARDERS` config](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#eth_use_forwarders) option to enable transactions forwarding contracts.

- In the `directrequest` job pipeline, three new block variables are available:

  - `$(jobRun.blockReceiptsRoot)` : the root of the receipts trie of the block (hash)
  - `$(jobRun.blockTransactionsRoot)` : the root of the transaction trie of the block (hash)
  - `$(jobRun.blockStateRoot)` : the root of the final state trie of the block (hash)

- `ethtx` tasks can now be configured to error if the transaction reverts on-chain. You must set `failOnRevert=true` on the task to enable this behavior:

  `foo [type=ethtx failOnRevert=true ...]`

  The `ethtx` task now works as follows:

  - If `minConfirmations == 0`, task always succeeds and nil is passed as output.
  - If `minConfirmations > 0`, the receipt is passed through as output.
  - If `minConfirmations > 0` and `failOnRevert=true` then the `ethtx` task will error on revert.
  - If `minConfirmations` is not set on the task, the chain default will be used which is usually 12 and always greater than 0.

- `http` task now allows specification of request headers. Use it like the following example:

  `foo [type=http headers="[\\"X-Header-1\\", \\"value1\\", \\"X-Header-2\\", \\"value2\\"]"]`.

### Fixed

- Fixed `max_unconfirmed_age` metric. Previously this would incorrectly report the max time since the last rebroadcast, capping the upper limit to the EthResender interval. This now reports the correct value of total time elapsed since the _first_ broadcast.

- Correctly handle the case where bumped gas would exceed the RPC node's configured maximum on Fantom. Note that node operators should check their Fantom RPC node configuration and remove the fee cap if there is one.

- Fixed handling of the Metis internal fee change.

### Removed

- The `Optimism` OVM 1.0 `GAS_ESTIMATOR_MODE` has been removed and the `Optimism2` `GAS_ESTIMATOR_MODE` has been renamed to `L2Suggested`.

- `MIN_OUTGOING_CONFIRMATIONS` has been removed and no longer has any effect. The [`ETH_FINALITY_DEPTH` environment variable](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#eth_finality_depth) is now used as the default for `ethtx` confirmations instead. You can override this on a per-task basis by setting `minConfirmations` in the task definition. For example, `foo [type=ethtx minConfirmations=42 ...]`.

  This setting might have a minor impact on performance for very high throughput chains. If you don't care about reporting task status in the UI, set `minConfirmations=0` in your job specs. For more details, see the [Optimizing EVM Performance](/chainlink-nodes/resources/evm-performance-configuration/#adjusting-minimum-outgoing-confirmations-for-high-throughput-jobs) page.

## Changes in v1.4.1 nodes

**[v1.4.1 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.4.1)**

- Added a fix to ensure that a failed `EthSubscribe` does not register `(*rpc.ClientSubscription)(nil)`, which leads to a panic when unsubscribing.
- Fix parsing of float values on job specs.

## Changes in v1.4.0 nodes

**[v1.4.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.4.0)**

- JSON parse tasks in TOML now support a custom `separator` parameter to substitute for the default `,`.
- Slow SQL queries are now logged.
- Updated the block explorer URLs to include FTMScan and SnowTrace.
- Keeper upkeep order can now be shuffled.
- Several fixes. See the [release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.4.0) for a full list of changes.

## Changes in v1.3.0 nodes

**[v1.3.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.3.0)**

- Added disk rotating logs. See the [Node Logging](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#logging) and [LOG_FILE_MAX_SIZE](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#log_file_max_size) documentation for details.
- Added support for the `force` flag on the `chainlink blocks replay` CLI command. If set to true, already consumed logs that would otherwise be skipped will be rebroadcasted.
- Added a version compatibility check when using the CLI to login to a remote node. The `bypass-version-check` flag skips this check.
- Changed default locking mode to "dual". See the [DATABASE_LOCKING_MODE](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#database_locking_mode) documentation for details.
- Specifying multiple EVM RPC nodes with the same URL is no longer supported. If you see `ERROR 0106_evm_node_uniqueness.sql: failed to run SQL migration`, you have multiple nodes specified with the same URL and you must fix this before proceeding with the upgrade.
- EIP-1559 is now enabled by default on the Ethereum Mainnet. See the [EVM_EIP1559_DYNAMIC_FEES](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#evm_eip1559_dynamic_fees) documentation for details.
- Added new Chainlink Automation feature that includes gas price in calls to `checkUpkeep()`. To enable the feature, set `KEEPER_CHECK_UPKEEP_GAS_PRICE_FEATURE_ENABLED` to `true`. Use this setting _only_ on Polygon networks.

## Changes in v1.2.0 nodes

**[v1.2.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.2.0)**

<Aside type="caution" title="Not for use on Solana or Terra">
  Although this release provides `SOLANA_ENABLED` and `TERRA_ENABLED` environment variables, these are not intended for
  use on Solana or Terra mainnet blockchains.
</Aside>

Significant changes:

- Added support for the [Nethermind Ethereum client](https://nethermind.io).
- Added support for batch sending telemetry to the ingress server to improve performance.
- New environment variables: See the [release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.2.0) for details.
- Removed the `deleteuser` CLI command.
- Removed the `LOG_TO_DISK` environment variable.

## Changes in v1.1.0 nodes

**[v1.1.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.1.0)**

The v1.1.0 release includes several substantial changes to the way you configure and operate Chainlink nodes:

- **Legacy environment variables**: Legacy environment variables are supported, but they might be removed in future node versions. See the [Configuring Chainlink Nodes](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration/#evmethereum-legacy-environment-variables) page to learn how to migrate your nodes away from legacy environment variables and use the API, CLI, or GUI exclusively to administer chains and nodes.
- **Full EIP1559 Support**: Chainlink nodes include experimental support for submitting transactions using type 0x2 (EIP-1559) envelope. EIP-1559 mode is off by default, but can be enabled either globally or on a per-chain basis.
- **New log level added**:
  - [crit]: Critical level logs are more severe than [error] and require quick action from the node operator.
- **Multichain support (Beta)**: Chainlink now supports connecting to multiple different EVM chains simultaneously. This is disabled by default. See the [v1.1.0 Changelog](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/v1.1.0/docs/CHANGELOG.md#multichain-support-added) for details.

With multliple chain support, eth node configuration is stored in the database.

The following environment variables are DEPRECATED:

- ETH_URL
- ETH_HTTP_URL
- ETH_SECONDARY_URLS

Setting ETH_URL will cause Chainlink to automatically overwrite the database records with the given ENV values every time Chainlink boots. This behavior is used mainly to ease the process of upgrading from older versions, and on subsequent runs (once your old settings have been written to the database) it is recommended to unset these ENV vars and use the API commands exclusively to administer chains and nodes.

If you wish to continue using these environment variables (as it used to work in 1.0.0 and below) you must ensure that the following are set:

- ETH_CHAIN_ID (mandatory)
- ETH_URL (mandatory)
- ETH_HTTP_URL (optional)
- ETH_SECONDARY_URLS (optional)

If, instead, you wish to use the API/CLI/GUI to configure your chains and eth nodes (recommended) you must REMOVE the following environment variables:

- ETH_URL
- ETH_HTTP_URL
- ETH_SECONDARY_URLS

This will cause Chainlink to use the database for its node configuration.

NOTE: ETH_CHAIN_ID does not need to be removed, since it now performs the additional duty of specifying the default chain in a multichain environment (if you leave ETH_CHAIN_ID unset, the default chain is simply the "first").

For more information on configuring your node, check the [configuration variables in the docs](/chainlink-nodes/v1/configuration).

Before you upgrade your nodes to v1.1.0, be aware of the following requirements:

- If you are upgrading from a previous version, you **MUST** first upgrade the node to at least [v0.10.15](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v0.10.15).
- Always take a Database snapshot before you upgrade your Chainlink nodes. You must be able to roll the node back to a previous version in the event of an upgrade failure.

See the [v1.1.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.1.0) for a complete list of changes and fixes.

## Changes in v1.0.0 and v1.0.1 nodes

**[v1.0.0 release notes](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/releases/tag/v1.0.0)**
