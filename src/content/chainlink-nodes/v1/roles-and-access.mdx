Chainlink Nodes allow the root admin CLI user and any additional admin users to create and assign tiers of role-based access to new users. These new API users can able to log in to the Operator UI independently.

Each user has a specific role assigned to their account. There are four roles: `admin`, `edit`, `run`, and `view`.

If there are multiple users who need specific access to manage the Chainlink Node instance, permissions and level of access can be set here.

User management is configured through the use of the admin `chainlink admin users` command. Run `chainlink admin login` before you set user roles for other accounts. For example, a view-only user can be created with the following command:

```shell
chainlink admin users create --email=operator-ui-view-only@test.com --role=view
```

To modify permissions or delete existing users, run the `admin users chrole` or `admin users delete` commands. Use the `-h` flag to get a full list of options for these commands:

```shell
chainlink admin users chrole -h
```

```shell
chainlink admin users delete -h
```

Specific actions are enabled to check role-based access before they execute. The following table lists the actions that have role-based access and the role that is required to run that action:

| Action                                        | View | Run | Edit | Admin |

The run command allows for minimal interaction and only enables the ability to replay a specific block number and kick off a job run.
