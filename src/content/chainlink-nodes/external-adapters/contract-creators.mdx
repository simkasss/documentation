### Using parameters with an external adapter

As a contract creator, using an external adapter is no different than creating a request for any other job spec. You will simply need to know which parameters are supported by the adapter. Notice the method below uses `req.add` to create a run parameter for each required value.

```solidity
function requestMWAPrice(string _coin, string _market)
  public
  onlyOwner
  returns (bytes32 requestId)
{
  Chainlink.Request memory req = buildChainlinkRequest(SPEC_ID, this, this.fulfill.selector);
  req.add("endpoint", "mwa-historic");
  req.add("coin", _coin);
  req.add("market", _market);
  req.add("copyPath", "data.-1.1");
  req.addInt("times", 100);
  requestId = sendChainlinkRequest(req, oraclePayment);
}
```

### Using the Copy adapter with an external adapter

The [Copy](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/v1/adapters/#copy) adapter allows for the same functionality of the [JsonParse](/chainlink-nodes/oracle-jobs/v1/adapters/#jsonparse) adapter but for getting data from the external adapter's response.

For example, if an adapter returns JSON data like what is below:

```json
{
  "firstValue": "SomeValue",
  "details": {
    "close": "100",
    "open": "110",
    "current": "111"
  },
  "other": "GetData"
}
```

And you wanted the value in the field "open", you would specify the path for the adapter to walk through the JSON object to your desired field.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json
"copyPath": ["details", "open"]
```

In Solidity, this would look like:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```solidity
string[] memory path = new string[](2);
path[0] = "details";
path[1] = "open";
run.addStringArray("copyPath", path);
```

Or you can use dot-notation <a href="https://jsonpath.com/">JSONPath</a> to simplify it:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```solidity
run.add("copyPath", "details.open")
```
