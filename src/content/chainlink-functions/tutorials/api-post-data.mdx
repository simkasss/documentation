This tutorial shows you how to send a request to a Decentralized Oracle Network to call the [Countries information GraphQL API](https://trevorblades.github.io/countries/queries/continent). After [OCR](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts) completes off-chain computation and aggregation, it returns the name, capital, and currency for the specified country to your smart contract. Because the endpoint is a GraphQL API, write a function that sends a GraphQL query in a [POST HTTP method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/POST).

<Aside type="note" title="Maximum response size">
  You can return any number of responses as long as they are encoded in a `bytes` response. The maximum response size
  that you can return is 256 bytes.
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution" title="Side effects">
  Building non-idempotent requests, such as sending an email or storing data on the cloud, is currently not recommended.
  An HTTP method is idempotent if the intended effect on the server when you make a single request is the same as the
  effect when you make several identical requests. Each oracle node runs the same computation in the [Off-chain
  Reporting protocol](/architecture-overview/off-chain-reporting). If your Chainlink Function makes non-idempotent
  requests, it will cause redundant requests such as sending multiple emails or storing the same data multiple times.

## Tutorial

This tutorial is configured to get the country name, capital, and currency from [countries.trevorblades.com](https://countries.trevorblades.com/) in one request. For a detailed explanation of the code example, read the [Explanation](#explanation) section.

- Open `config.js`. The `args` value is `["JP"]` to fetch information about Japan. You can adapt `args` to retrieve information about other countries as well. Read the [Trevorblades API docs](https://github.com/trevorblades/countries) to get the list of supported countries. For more information about the request config file, read the [request config explanation](#configjs).
- Open `source.js` to analyze the JavaScript source code. Read the [source code explanation](#sourcejs) for a more detailed explanation of the source code file.

### Simulation

The [Chainlink Functions Hardhat Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) includes a simulator to test your Functions code on your local machine. The `functions-simulate` command executes your code in a local runtime environment and simulates an end-to-end fulfillment. This helps you to fix issues before you submit your functions to a Decentralized Oracle Network.

Run the `functions-simulate` task to run the source code locally and make sure `config.js` and `source.js` are correctly written:

```bash
npx hardhat functions-simulate --configpath REPLACE_CONFIG_PATH
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-simulate --configpath tutorials/4-post-data/config.js

The output of this example tells you that the country name is _Japan_, capital is _Tokyo_, and the currency is _JPY_. Because the final result is a JSON object, convert it to a string and return the `bytes` encoded value `0x7b226e616d65223a224a6170616e222c226361706974616c223a22546f6b796f222c2263757272656e6379223a224a5059227d` in the callback. Read the [source code explanation](#sourcejs) for a more detailed explanation.

### Request

<Aside type="note" title="Reminder">
  Before you can make a successful request, you must complete the setup steps in the [Before you
  begin](#before-you-begin) section. Each tutorial is in a separate Git branch and some require unique entries in your
  `.env.enc` file.
</Aside>

Send a request to the Decentralized Oracle Network to run the GraphQL query. Run the `functions-request` task with the `subid` (subscription ID) and `contract` parameters. This task passes the JavaScript source code, arguments, and secrets when it calls the `executeRequest` function in your deployed `FunctionsConsumer` contract. Read the [functionsConsumer](#functionsconsumersol) section for a more detailed explanation of the contract.

```bash
npx hardhat functions-request --subid REPLACE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --contract REPLACE_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network REPLACE_NETWORK --configpath REPLACE_CONFIG_PATH
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-request --subid 443 --contract 0x4B4BA2Fd6b93aDF8d6b6002E10540E58394388Ea --network polygonMumbai --configpath tutorials/4-post-data/config.js

```

The output of the example above gives you the following information:

- The `executeRequest` function was successfully called in the `FunctionsConsumer` contract. The transaction in this example is [0xb52fa5780be565ee0df732765d2e0e08e827e46be1df1f1eadab98a717c78c2b](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0xb52fa5780be565ee0df732765d2e0e08e827e46be1df1f1eadab98a717c78c2b).
- The request ID is `0xfd3458d471506c9c59fce518d8b7267240940903e4a42dac144a29b90c9c9ab4`.
- The DON successfully fulfilled your request. The total cost was: `0.200067030219895325 LINK`.
- The consumer contract received a response in `bytes` with a value of `0x7b226e616d65223a224a6170616e222c226361706974616c223a22546f6b796f222c2263757272656e6379223a224a5059227d`. Decoding it off-chain to a `string` gives you a result: `{"name":"Japan","capital":"Tokyo","currency":"JPY"}`.

At any time, you can run the `functions-read` task again with the `contract` parameter to read the latest received response.

```bash
npx hardhat functions-read  --contract REPLACE_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network REPLACE_NETWORK --configpath REPLACE_CONFIG_PATH
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-read  --contract 0x4B4BA2Fd6b93aDF8d6b6002E10540E58394388Ea  --network polygonMumbai --configpath tutorials/4-post-data/config.js

```

Decoding `0x7b226e616d65223a224a6170616e222c226361706974616c223a22546f6b796f222c2263757272656e6379223a224a5059227d` from `bytes` to `string` gives you a string `{"name":"Japan","capital":"Tokyo","currency":"JPY"}`. Off-chain, you can use [JSON.parse()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) to convert the JSON string to a JSON object.

## Explanation

### FunctionsConsumer.sol

<ChainlinkFunctions section="functions-consumer" />

### config.js

Read the [Request Configuration](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#functions-library) section for a detailed description of each setting. In this example, the settings are the following:

- `codeLocation: Location.Inline`: The JavaScript code is provided within the request.
- `codeLanguage: CodeLanguage.JavaScript`: The source code is developed in the JavaScript language.
- `source: fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, "source.js")).toString()`: The source code must be a script object. This example uses `fs.readFileSync` to read `source.js` and calls `toString()` to get the content as a `string` object.
- `args: ["JP"]`: These arguments are passed to the source code. You can change the country code to request information of another country.
- `expectedReturnType: ReturnType.string`: The response the DON receives is encoded in `bytes`. Because the country name, capital, and currency are put in a JSON string, define `ReturnType.string` to inform users how to decode the response received by the DON. Read the [source code explanation](#sourcejs) for more information.`

### source.js

To check the expected API response:

- In your browser, open the countries GraphQL playground: `https://countries.trevorblades.com/`

- Write this query:

  ```
  {
  country(code: "JP") {
      name
      capital
      currency
  }
  }
  ```

- Click on _play_ to get the answer :

  ```json
  {
    "data": {
      "country": {
        "name": "Japan",
        "capital": "Tokyo",
        "currency": "JPY"
      }
    }
  }
  ```

Read the [JavaScript code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#javascript-code) section for a detailed explanation of how to write a compatible JavaScript source code. This JavaScript source code uses [Functions.makeHttpRequest](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#functions-library) to make HTTP requests. To request the `JP` country information, the source code calls the `https://countries.trevorblades.com/` URL and provides the query data in the HTTP request body. If you read the [Functions.makeHttpRequest](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#functions-library) documentation, you see that you must provide the following parameters:

- url: `https://countries.trevorblades.com/`
- data (HTTP body):

  ```
  {
      query: `{\
          country(code: "${countryCode}") { \
          name \
          capital \
          currency \
          } \
      }`,
  }
  ```

The `countryCode` is fetched from the `args`. See the [request config](#configjs) section for more information.

The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps. The main steps are:

- Construct the HTTP object `countryRequest` using `Functions.makeHttpRequest`.
- Run the HTTP request.
- Read the country name, capital, and currency from the response.
- Construct a JSON object:

  ```javascript
  const result = {
    name: countryData.country.name,
    capital: countryData.country.capital,
    currency: countryData.country.currency,
  }
  ```

- Convert the JSON object to a JSON string using `JSON.stringify(result)`. This step is mandatory before encoding `string` to `bytes`.
- Return the result as a [buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) using the `Functions.string` helper function. **Note**: Read this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/do-you-want-a-better-understanding-of-buffer-in-node-js-check-this-out-2e29de2968e8/) if you are new to Javascript Buffers and want to understand why they are important.
