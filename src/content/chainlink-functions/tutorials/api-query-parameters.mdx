This tutorial shows you how to send a request to a Decentralized Oracle Network to call the [Cryptocompare GET /data/pricemultifull API](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation?key=Price&cat=multipleSymbolsFullPriceEndpoint). After [OCR](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts) completes off-chain computation and aggregation, it returns the asset price for ETH/USD to your smart contract. This guide also shows you how to configure HTTP query parameters to request different asset prices.

1. **[Complete the setup steps in the Getting Started guide](/chainlink-functions/getting-started):** The Getting Started Guide shows you how to set up your environment with the necessary tools for these tutorials. You can re-use the same consumer contract for each of these tutorials.

1. Make sure your subscription has enough LINK to pay for your requests. Read [Get Subscription details](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#get-subscription-details) to learn how to check your subscription balance. If your subscription runs out of LINK, follow the [Fund a Subscription](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#fund-a-subscription) guide.

1. Check out the _tutorials_ branch of the [Chainlink Functions Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit). You can locate this tutorial in [the _/tutorials/2-call-api_ directory](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit/tree/tutorials/tutorials/2-call-api).

   ```bash
   git checkout tutorials
   ```

## Tutorial

This tutorial is configured to get the `ETH/USD` price. For a detailed explanation of the code example, read the [Explanation](#explanation) section.

- Open `config.js`. The `args` value is `["ETH", "USD"]`, which fetches the current `ETH/USD` price. You can adapt `args` to fetch another asset price. See the [CryptoCompare API docs](https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/documentation?key=Price&cat=multipleSymbolsFullPriceEndpoint) to get the list of supported symbols. Read the [request config explanation](#configjs) for a more detailed explanation about the request config file.
- Open `source.js` to analyze the JavaScript source code. Read the [source code explanation](#sourcejs) for a more detailed explanation.

### Simulation

The [Chainlink Functions Hardhat Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) includes a simulator to test your Functions code on your local machine. The `functions-simulate` command executes your code in a local runtime environment and simulates an end-to-end fulfillment. This helps you to fix any issues before you submit your functions to a Decentralized Oracle Network.

Run the `functions-simulate` task to run the source code locally and make sure `config.js` and `source.js` are correctly written:

```bash
npx hardhat functions-simulate --configpath REPLACE_CONFIG_PATH
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-simulate --configpath tutorials/2-call-api/config.js

```

Reading the output of the example above, you can see that the `ETH/USD` price is: _1813.50 USD_. Because Solidity does not support decimals, we move the decimal point so that the value looks like an integer `181350` before returning the `bytes` encoded value `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002c466` in the callback. Read the [source code explanation](#sourcejs) for more information about the source code.

### Request

<Aside type="note" title="Reminder">
  Before you can make a successful request, you must complete the setup steps in the [Before you
  begin](#before-you-begin) section. Each tutorial is in a separate Git branch and some require unique entries in your
  `.env.enc` file.
</Aside>

Send a request to the Decentralized Oracle Network to fetch the asset price. Run the `functions-request` task with the `subid` (subscription ID) and `contract` parameters. This task passes the functions JavaScript source code, arguments, and secrets to the `executeRequest` function in your deployed `FunctionsConsumer` contract. Read the [functionsConsumer](#functionsconsumersol) section for more information about the consumer contract.

```bash
npx hardhat functions-request --subid REPLACE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --contract REPLACE_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network REPLACE_NETWORK --configpath REPLACE_CONFIG_PATH
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-request --subid 443 --contract 0x4B4BA2Fd6b93aDF8d6b6002E10540E58394388Ea --network polygonMumbai --configpath tutorials/2-call-api/config.js

```

The output of the example above gives you the following information:

- The `executeRequest` function was successfully called in the `FunctionsConsumer` contract. The transaction in this example is [0x36029c2e49d0d890d00a1b554e4bea564444e48c5449f9d5deaed5d42114d91e](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0x36029c2e49d0d890d00a1b554e4bea564444e48c5449f9d5deaed5d42114d91e).
- The request ID is `0x5e89f3e84cbf80d65de53de816052d1b79c50c1f1f9f283aadc3ad36d33d41aa`.
- The DON successfully fulfilled your request. The total cost was: `0.200063268449037502 LINK`.
- The consumer contract received a response in `bytes` with a value of `0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002c48b`. Decoding it off-chain to a `uint256` gives you a result: `181387`.

At any time, you can run the `functions-read` task again with the `contract` parameter to read the latest received response.

```bash
npx hardhat functions-read  --contract REPLACE_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network REPLACE_NETWORK --configpath REPLACE_CONFIG_PATH
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-read  --contract 0x4B4BA2Fd6b93aDF8d6b6002E10540E58394388Ea  --network polygonMumbai --configpath tutorials/2-call-api/config.js

## Explanation

### FunctionsConsumer.sol

<ChainlinkFunctions section="functions-consumer" />

### config.js

Read the [Request Configuration](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#functions-library) section for a detailed description of each setting. In this example, the settings are the following:

- `codeLocation: Location.Inline`: The JavaScript code is provided within the request.
- `codeLanguage: CodeLanguage.JavaScript`: The source code is developed in the JavaScript language.
- `source: fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, "source.js")).toString()`: The source code must be a script object. This example uses `fs.readFileSync` to read `source.js` and calls `toString()` to get the content as a `string` object.
- `args: ["ETH", "USD"]`: These arguments are passed to the source code. This example requests the `ETH/USD` price.
- `expectedReturnType: ReturnType.uint256`: The response received by the DON is encoded in `bytes`. Because the asset price is a `uint256`, define `ReturnType.uint256` to inform users how to decode the response received by the DON.

### source.js

To check the expected API response, you can directly paste the following URL in your browser `https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD` or run the `curl` command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD' \
  -H 'accept: application/json'
```

The response should be similar to the following example:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json
{
  "RAW": {
    "ETH": {
      "USD": {
        "TYPE": "5",
        "MARKET": "CCCAGG",
        "FROMSYMBOL": "ETH",
        "TOSYMBOL": "USD",
        "FLAGS": "2049",
        "PRICE": 2867.04,
        "LASTUPDATE": 1650896942,
        "MEDIAN": 2866.2,
        "LASTVOLUME": 0.16533939,
        "LASTVOLUMETO": 474.375243849,
        "LASTTRADEID": "1072154517",
        "VOLUMEDAY": 195241.78281014622,
        "VOLUMEDAYTO": 556240560.4621655,
        "VOLUME24HOUR": 236248.94641103,
        ...
}
```

The price is located at `RAW,ETH,USD,PRICE`.

Read the [JavaScript code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#javascript-code) section for a detailed explanation of how to write a compatible JavaScript source code. This JavaScript source code uses [Functions.makeHttpRequest](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#functions-library) to make HTTP requests. To request the `ETH/USD` price, the source code calls the `https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull?fsyms=ETH&tsyms=USD` URL. If you read the [Functions.makeHttpRequest](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#functions-library) documentation, you see that you must provide the following parameters:

- `url`: `https://min-api.cryptocompare.com/data/pricemultifull`
- `params`: The query parameters object:

  ```
  {
    fsyms: fromSymbol,
    tsyms: toSymbol
  }
  ```

The `fromSymbol` and `toSymbol` values are fetched from `args`. See the [request config](#configjs) section for more details.

The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps. The main steps are:

- Construct the HTTP object `cryptoCompareRequest` using `Functions.makeHttpRequest`.
- Make the HTTP call.
- Read the asset price from the response.
- Return the result as a [buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) using the `Functions.encodeUint256` helper function. Because solidity doesn't support decimals, multiply the result by `100` and round the result to the nearest integer. **Note**: Read this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/do-you-want-a-better-understanding-of-buffer-in-node-js-check-this-out-2e29de2968e8/) if you are new to Javascript Buffers and want to understand why they are important.
