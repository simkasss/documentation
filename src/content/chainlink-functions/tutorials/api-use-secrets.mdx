This tutorial shows you how to send a request to a Decentralized Oracle Network to call the [Coinmarketcap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/). After [OCR](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts) completes off-chain computation and aggregation, it returns the `BTC/USD` asset price to your smart contract. Because the API requires you to provide an API key, this guide will also show you how to encrypt, sign your API key, and share it off-chain with a Decentralized Oracle Network (DON).

The Chainlink Functions starter kit creates [gists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) containing encrypted secrets on your behalf. Then, it shares the gist URL with the DON. This method comes with a security benefit:

- The encrypted secrets are never stored on-chain. The secrets are encrypted with the DON's public key so that only an oracle node in the DON can decrypt them using the DON's private key. After the DON fulfills a request, the starter kit deletes the gist. This revokes the credentials after the DON has fulfilled the request.

<Aside type="caution">
  Chainlink Functions is still in BETA. Please utilize credentials that are assigned for your testing purposes only and
  that do not secure sensitive data or real value. The use of secrets in your requests is an experimental feature that
  may not operate as expected and is subject to change. Use of this feature is at your own risk and may result in
  unexpected errors, possible revealing of the secret as new versions are released, or other issues.

1.  **[Complete the setup steps in the Getting Started guide](/chainlink-functions/getting-started):** The Getting Started Guide shows you how to set up your environment with the necessary tools for these tutorials. You can re-use the same consumer contract for each of these tutorials.

1.  Make sure your subscription has enough LINK to pay for your requests. Read [Get Subscription details](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#get-subscription-details) to learn how to check your subscription balance. If your subscription runs out of LINK, follow the [Fund a Subscription](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#fund-a-subscription) guide.

1.  Check out the _tutorials_ branch of the [Chainlink Functions Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit). You can locate this tutorial in [the _/tutorials/5-use-secrets_ directory](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit/tree/tutorials/tutorials/5-use-secrets).

    ```bash
    git checkout tutorials
    ```

1.  Get a free API key from [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) and note your API key.

1.  The starter kit store encrypted secrets as [gists](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/editing-and-sharing-content-with-gists/creating-gists) to share them off-chain with the Decentralized Oracle Network. To allow the starter kit to write gists on your behalf, create a [github fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token).

    1. Visit [Github tokens settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta).
    1. Click on _Generate new token_.
    1. Provide a name to your token and define the expiration date.
    1. Under `Account permissions`, enable _Read and write_ for Gists. **Note**: Do not enable additional settings.
    1. Click on _Generate token_ and copy your fine-grained personal access token.

1.  Run `npx env-enc set` to add an encrypted `GITHUB_API_TOKEN` and `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` to your `.env.enc` file.

    ```shell
    npx env-enc set
    ```

## Tutorial

<Aside type="note" title="Set up your environment variables">
  This tutorial has some unique `.env.enc` setup steps. Make sure that you configured your `.env.enc` file with the
  necessary variables in the [Before you begin](#before-you-begin) section.
</Aside>

This tutorial is configured to get the `BTC/USD` price with a request that requires API keys. For a detailed explanation of the code example, read the [Explanation](#explanation) section.

- Open `config.js`. The `args` value is `["1", "USD"]`, which fetches the current `BTC/USD` price. The value of `"1"` is the BTC CoinMarketCap ID. You can change `args` to fetch other asset prices. See the [CoinMarketCap API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/) to learn about the available values. Read the [request config](#configjs) section for more details about the request config file.
- Open `source.js` to analyze the JavaScript source code. Read the [source code](#sourcejs) section for more details about the source code file.

### Simulation

The [Chainlink Functions Hardhat Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) includes a simulator to test Functions code on your local machine. The `functions-simulate` command executes your code in a local runtime environment and simulate an end-to-end fulfillment. This helps you fix issues before you submit functions to a Decentralized Oracle Network.

Run the `functions-simulate` task to run the source code locally and make sure `config.js` and `source.js` are correctly written:

```bash
npx hardhat functions-simulate --configpath REPLACE_CONFIG_PATH
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-simulate --configpath tutorials/5-use-secrets/config.js

Reading the output of the example above, you can note that the `BTC/USD` price is _28272.77 USD_. Because Solidity does not support decimals, move the decimal point so that the value looks like an integer `2827277` before returning the `bytes` encoded value `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002b240d` in the callback. Read the [source code](#sourcejs) section for a more details.

### Request

<Aside type="note" title="Reminder">
  Before you can make a successful request, you must complete the setup steps in the [Before you
  begin](#before-you-begin) section. Each tutorial is in a separate Git branch and some require unique entries in your
  `.env.enc` file.
</Aside>

Send a request to the Decentralized Oracle Network to fetch the asset price. Run the `functions-request` task with the `subid` (subscription ID) and `contract` parameters. This task passes the functions JavaScript source code, arguments, and secrets to the `executeRequest` function in your deployed `FunctionsConsumer` contract. Read the [functionsConsumer](#functionsconsumersol) section for more details about the consumer contract.

```bash
npx hardhat functions-request --subid REPLACE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --contract REPLACE_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network REPLACE_NETWORK --configpath REPLACE_CONFIG_PATH
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-request --subid 443 --contract 0x4B4BA2Fd6b93aDF8d6b6002E10540E58394388Ea --network polygonMumbai --configpath tutorials/5-use-secrets/config.js

Off-chain secrets Gist https://gist.github.com/aelmanaa/677f0b039b5036d9ab9f09caa7d3ecd5 deleted successfully
```

The example output tells you the following information:

- The `executeRequest` function was successfully called in the `FunctionsConsumer` contract. The transaction in this example is [0x1cd9edfb6ee3dc6c45038d93a2b146217fd104eb92fe82a1c9203d4f83ced5d6](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0x1cd9edfb6ee3dc6c45038d93a2b146217fd104eb92fe82a1c9203d4f83ced5d6).
- The request ID is `0x958c7b88f2edb0d827e9ca8b5d5e63ee373527a409099983e18a69c16ebc4a24`.
- The DON successfully fulfilled your request. The total cost was: `0.200066649973244399 LINK`.
- The consumer contract received a response in `bytes` with a value of `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002b20eb`. Decoding it off-chain to `uint256` give you a result: `2826475`.
- The starter kit created a gist `https://gist.github.com/aelmanaa/677f0b039b5036d9ab9f09caa7d3ecd5` containing the encrypted secrets. This gist is shared with the DON when making the request.
- After request fulfillment, the starter kit deleted the gist `https://gist.github.com/aelmanaa/677f0b039b5036d9ab9f09caa7d3ecd5`.

At any time, you can run the `functions-read` task with the `contract` parameter to read the latest received response.

```bash
npx hardhat functions-read  --contract REPLACE_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network REPLACE_NETWORK --configpath REPLACE_CONFIG_PATH
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-read  --contract 0x4B4BA2Fd6b93aDF8d6b6002E10540E58394388Ea  --network polygonMumbai --configpath tutorials/5-use-secrets/config.js

## Explanation

### FunctionsConsumer.sol

<ChainlinkFunctions section="functions-consumer" />

### config.js

Read the [Request Configuration](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#functions-library) section for a detailed description of each setting. In this example, the settings are the following:

- `codeLocation: Location.Inline`: The JavaScript code is provided within the request.
- `codeLanguage: CodeLanguage.JavaScript`: The source code is developed in the JavaScript language.
- `source: fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, "source.js")).toString()`: The source code must be a script object. This example uses `fs.readFileSync` to read `source.js` and calls `toString()` to get the content as a `string` object.
- `secrets: { apiKey: process.env.COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY }`: JavaScript object which contains secret values. These secrets are encrypted using the DON public key. The `process.env.COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` setting means `COINMARKETCAP_API_KEY` is fetched from the environment variables. **Note**: `secrets` is limited to a key-value map that can only contain strings. It cannot include any other types or nested parameters.
- `walletPrivateKey: process.env["PRIVATE_KEY"]`: This is your EVM account private key. It is used to generate a signature for the encrypted secrets such that an unauthorized third party cannot reuse them.
- `args: ["1", "USD"]`: These arguments are passed to the source code. In this example, request the `BTC/USD` price. The value of `"1"` is the BTC ID for CoinMarketCap. You can adapt `args` to fetch other asset prices. Read the [CoinMarketCap API documentation](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/) to see what options are available.
- `expectedReturnType: ReturnType.uint256`: The response received by the DON is encoded in `bytes`. Because the asset price is a `uint256`, define `ReturnType.uint256` to inform users how to decode the response received by the DON.

### source.js

To check the expected API response, run the `curl` command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -X 'GET' \
  'https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest?id=1&convert=USD' \
  -H 'accept: application/json' \
  -H 'X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY: REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_API_KEY'
```

The response should be similar to the following example:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json
{
  ...,
  "data": {
    "1": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Bitcoin",
      "symbol": "BTC",
      "slug": "bitcoin",
      ...,
      "quote": {
        "USD": {
          "price": 23036.068560170934,
          "volume_24h": 33185308895.694683,
          "volume_change_24h": 24.8581,
          "percent_change_1h": 0.07027098,
          "percent_change_24h": 1.79073805,
          "percent_change_7d": 10.29859656,
          "percent_change_30d": 38.10735851,
          "percent_change_60d": 39.26624921,
          "percent_change_90d": 11.59835416,
          "market_cap": 443982488416.99316,
          "market_cap_dominance": 42.385,
          "fully_diluted_market_cap": 483757439763.59,
          "tvl": null,
          "last_updated": "2023-01-26T18:27:00.000Z"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The price is located at `data,1,quote,USD,price`.

Read the [JavaScript code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#javascript-code) section for a detailed explanation of how to write a compatible JavaScript source code. This JavaScript source code uses [Functions.makeHttpRequest](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#functions-library) to make HTTP requests. If you read the [Functions.makeHttpRequest](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#functions-library) documentation, you can see the following required parameters:

- `url`: `https://pro-api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/cryptocurrency/quotes/latest`
- `headers`: This is an HTTP headers object set to `{ "X-CMC_PRO_API_KEY": secrets.apiKey }`. The `apiKey` is defined in the [request config file](#configjs).
- `params`: The query parameters object:

  ```
  {
    convert: currencyCode,
    id: coinMarketCapCoinId
  }
  ```

Note `currencyCode` and `coinMarketCapCoinId` are fetched from `args` (see [request config](#configjs)).

The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps. The main steps are:

- Construct the HTTP object `coinMarketCapRequest` using `Functions.makeHttpRequest`.
- Make the HTTP call.
- Read the asset price from the response.
- Return the result as a [buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) using the helper function: `Functions.encodeUint256`. Note: Because solidity doesn't support decimals, we multiply the result by `100` and round the result to the nearest integer. **Note**: Read this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/do-you-want-a-better-understanding-of-buffer-in-node-js-check-this-out-2e29de2968e8/) if you are new to Javascript Buffers and want to understand why they are important.
