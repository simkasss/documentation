This tutorial shows you how to run computations on the Chainlink Functions Decentralized Oracle Network (DON). The example code computes the [geometric mean](https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/geometric-mean.html) of numbers in a list. After [OCR](/chainlink-functions/resources/concepts) completes off-chain computation and aggregation, it returns the result to your smart contract.

1. **[Complete the setup steps in the Getting Started guide](/chainlink-functions/getting-started):** The Getting Started Guide shows you how to set up your environment with the necessary tools for these tutorials. You can re-use the same consumer contract for each of these tutorials.

1. Make sure your subscription has enough LINK to pay for your requests. Read [Get Subscription details](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#get-subscription-details) to learn how to check your subscription balance. If your subscription runs out of LINK, follow the [Fund a Subscription](/chainlink-functions/resources/subscriptions#fund-a-subscription) guide.

1. Check out the _tutorials_ branch of the [Chainlink Functions Starter Kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit). You can locate this tutorial in [the _/tutorials/1-simple-computation_ directory](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit/tree/tutorials/tutorials/1-simple-computation).

   ```bash
   git checkout tutorials
   ```

## Tutorial

This tutorial is configured to get the average (geometric mean) from a list of numbers. For a detailed explanation of the code example, read the [Explanation](#explanation) section.

- Open `config.js`. Note that the `args` value is `["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10"]`, so the source code will calculate the average (geometric mean) of "1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10". You can change the `args` value to compute another set's average. Read the [request config explanation](#configjs) for more information about the request config file.
- Open `source.js` to analyze the JavaScript source code. Read the [source code explanation](#sourcejs) for a more detailed description of the source code.

### Simulation

The [Chainlink Functions hardhat starter kit](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit) includes a simulator to test your Functions code on your local machine. The `functions-simulate` command will execute your code in a local runtime environment and simulate an end-to-end fulfillment, helping you fix any issues before submitting your functions to a Decentralized Oracle Network.

Run the `functions-simulate` task to run the source code locally and make sure `config.js` and `source.js` are correctly written:

```bash
npx hardhat functions-simulate --configpath REPLACE_CONFIG_PATH
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-simulate --configpath tutorials/1-simple-computation/config.js

Decoded as a uint256: 453

Gas used by sendRequest: 351895
Gas used by client callback function: 75017
```

Reading the output of the example above, you can note that the geometric mean was correctly computed: `4.53`. Because Solidity does not support decimals, we move the decimal point so that the value looks like an integer `453` before returning the `bytes` encoded value `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001c5` in the callback. Note: Read the [source code explanation](#sourcejs) for a more detailed explanation.

### Request

<Aside type="note" title="Reminder">
  Before you can make a successful request, you must complete the setup steps in the [Before you
  begin](#before-you-begin) section. Each tutorial is in a separate Git branch and some require unique entries in your
  `.env.enc` file.
</Aside>

Send a request to the Decentralized Oracle Network to compute the average (geometric mean). Run the `functions-request` task with the `subid` (subscription ID) and `contract` parameters. This task will pass the functions JavaScript source code and any arguments and secrets when calling the `FunctionsConsumer`'s `executeRequest` function. Read the [functionsConsumer](#functionsconsumersol) section for more details about the consumer contract.

```bash
npx hardhat functions-request --subid REPLACE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID --contract REPLACE_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network REPLACE_NETWORK --configpath REPLACE_CONFIG_PATH
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-request --subid 443 --contract 0x4B4BA2Fd6b93aDF8d6b6002E10540E58394388Ea --network polygonMumbai --configpath tutorials/1-simple-computation/config.js

The output of the example gives you the following information:

- The `executeRequest` function was successfully called in the `FunctionsConsumer` contract. The transaction in this example is [0xa35ac46ec20a258cd9ffcc4a4396b998e3a60343a936009fb5fc76550c780d7f](https://mumbai.polygonscan.com/tx/0xa35ac46ec20a258cd9ffcc4a4396b998e3a60343a936009fb5fc76550c780d7f).
- The request ID is `0xa89547c0270c1a5135ec7a47b9110db495facd811493832f54cc4c0b729b7786`.
- The DON successfully fulfilled your request. The total cost was: `0.20006493686812304 LINK`.
- The consumer contract received a response in `bytes` with a value of `0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001c5`. Decoding it off-chain to `uint256` give you a result: `453`.

At any time, you can run the `functions-read` task with the `contract` parameter to read the latest received response.

```bash
npx hardhat functions-read  --contract REPLACE_CONSUMER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS --network REPLACE_NETWORK --configpath REPLACE_CONFIG_PATH
```

Example:

```text
$ npx hardhat functions-read  --contract 0x4B4BA2Fd6b93aDF8d6b6002E10540E58394388Ea  --network polygonMumbai --configpath tutorials/1-simple-computation/config.js

## Explanation

### FunctionsConsumer.sol

<ChainlinkFunctions section="functions-consumer" />

### config.js

Read the [Request Configuration](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#functions-library) section for a detailed description of each setting. In this example, the settings are the following:

- `codeLocation: Location.Inline`: The JavaScript code is provided within the request.
- `codeLanguage: CodeLanguage.JavaScript`: The source code is developed in the JavaScript language.
- `source: fs.readFileSync(path.resolve(__dirname, "source.js")).toString()`: The source code must be a script object. That's why we use `fs.readFileSync` to read `source.js` and then call `toString()` to get the content as a `string` object.
- `args: ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7", "8", "9", "10"]`: These arguments are passed to the source code. This example computes the average(geometric mean) of `1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10`.
- `expectedReturnType: ReturnType.uint256`: The response received by the DON is encoded in `bytes`. Because the average (geometric mean) is a `uint256`, define `ReturnType.uint256` to inform users how to decode the response received by the DON.

### source.js

Read the [JavaScript code](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/functions-hardhat-starter-kit#javascript-code) section for a detailed explanation of how to write compatible JavaScript source code. The code is self-explanatory and has comments to help you understand all the steps. The main steps are:

- Read the numbers provided as arguments in the `args` setting. Because `args` is an array of `string`, call `parseInt` to convert from `string` to `number`.
- Calculate the average (geometric mean): First, compute the product of the numbers. Then, calculate the nth root of the product where `n` is the length of `args`.
- Return the result as a [buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer) using the `Functions.encodeUint256` helper function. Because solidity doesn't support decimals, multiply the result by `100` and round the result to the nearest integer. **Note**: Read this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/do-you-want-a-better-understanding-of-buffer-in-node-js-check-this-out-2e29de2968e8/) if you are new to Javascript Buffers and want to understand why they are important.

It is important to note that the custom source code you want to execute in a Functions request can use vanilla Node.js features, but cannot use any require statements or imported modules other than the built-in modules buffer, crypto, querystring, string_decoder, url, and util.
