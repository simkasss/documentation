Use custom logic to allow Chainlink Automation to determine when to execute your smart contract functions.

Learn how to make smart contracts that are compatible with the `AutomationCompatibleInterface` contract and its functions. To understand the best practices when working with Chainlink Automation, click [here](/chainlink-automation/compatible-contract-best-practice).

<Aside type="tip" title="Considerations and Best Practices">

Before you deploy contracts to use with Chainlink Automation, read the [Best Practices](/chainlink-automation/compatible-contract-best-practice) guide. These best practices are important for using Chainlink Automation securely and reliably. You can also read more about the Chainlink Automation architecture [here](/chainlink-automation/overview).

</Aside>

## Example contract

To use Chainlink Automation, contracts must meet the following requirements:

- Import `AutomationCompatible.sol`. You can refer to the [Chainlink Contracts](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/tree/develop/contracts/src) on GitHub to find the latest version.
- Use the `AutomationCompatibleInterface` from the library to ensure your `checkUpkeep` and `performUpkeep` function definitions match the definitions expected by the Chainlink Automation Network.
- Include a `checkUpkeep` function that contains the logic that will be executed off-chain to see if `performUpkeep` should be executed. `checkUpkeep` can use on-chain data and a specified `checkData` parameter to perform complex calculations off-chain and then send the result to `performUpkeep` as `performData`.
- Include a `performUpkeep` function that will be executed on-chain when `checkUpkeep` returns `true`. Because `performUpkeep` is external, users are advised to revalidate conditions and performData.

Use these elements to create a compatible contract that will automatically increment a counter after every `updateInterval` seconds. After you register the contract as an upkeep, the Chainlink Automation Network simulates our `checkUpkeep` off-chain during every block to determine if the `updateInterval` time has passed since the last increment (timestamp). When `checkUpkeep` returns true, the Chainlink Automation Network calls `performUpkeep` on-chain and increments the counter. This cycle repeats until the upkeep is cancelled or runs out of funding.

<CodeSample src="samples/Automation/AutomationCounter.sol" />

Compile and deploy your own Automation Counter onto a [supported Testnet](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks).

1. In the Remix example, select the compile tab on the left and press the compile button. Make sure that your contract compiles without any errors. Note that the Warning messages in this example are acceptable and will not block the deployment.
1. Select the **Deploy** tab and deploy the `Counter` smart contract in the `injected web3` environment. When deploying the contract, specify the `updateInterval` value. For this example, set a short interval of 60. This is the interval at which the `performUpkeep` function will be called.
1. After deployment is complete, copy the address of the deployed contract. This address is required to register your upkeep in the [Automation UI](https://automation.chain.link/). The example in this document uses [custom logic](/chainlink-automation/register-upkeep) automation.

To see more complex examples, go to the [utility contracts](/chainlink-automation/tutorials/eth-balance) page.

We will now look at each function in a compatible contract in detail.

## Functions

| Function Name                            | Description                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [checkUpkeep](#checkupkeep-function)     | Runs off-chain at every block to determine if the `performUpkeep` function should be called on-chain. |
| [performUpkeep](#performupkeep-function) | Contains the logic that should be executed on-chain when `checkUpkeep` returns true.                  |

### `checkUpkeep` function

This function contains the logic that runs off-chain during every block as an `eth_call`[(link)](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#eth_call) to determine if `performUpkeep` should be executed on-chain. To reduce on-chain gas usage, attempt to do your gas intensive calculations off-chain in `checkUpkeep` and pass the result to `performUpkeep` on-chain.

<Aside type="note" title="Gas limits for checkUpkeep">
  The `checkUpkeep` function is subject to the `checkGasLimit` in the [registry
  configuration](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks/#configurations).
</Aside>

Because `checkUpkeep` is only off-chain in simulation it is best to treat this as a `view` function and not modify any state. This might not always be possible if you want to use more advanced Solidity features like `DelegateCall`[(link)](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/introduction-to-smart-contracts.html#delegatecall-callcode-and-libraries). It is a best practice to import the `AutomationCompatible.sol`[(link)](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/master/contracts/src/v0.8/AutomationCompatible.sol) contract and use the `cannotExecute` modifier to ensure that the method can be used only for simulation purposes.

```solidity
function checkUpkeep(
  bytes calldata checkData
) external view override returns (bool upkeepNeeded, bytes memory performData);
```

Below are the parameters and return values of the `checkUpkeep` function. Click each value to learn more about its design patterns and best practices:

**Parameters:**

- [`checkData`](#checkdata): Fixed and specified at upkeep registration and used in every `checkUpkeep`. Can be empty (0x).

**Return Values:**

- `upkeepNeeded`: Boolean that when True will trigger the on-chain `performUpkeep` call.
- [`performData`](#performdata): Bytes that will be used as input parameter when calling `performUpkeep`. If you would like to encode data to decode later, try `abi.encode`.

#### `checkData`

You can pass information into your `checkUpkeep` function from your [upkeep registration](/chainlink-automation/register-upkeep) to execute different code paths. For example, to check the balance on an specific address, set the `checkData` to abi encode the address. To learn how to create flexible upkeeps with checkData, please see out [flexible upkeeps](/chainlink-automation/flexible-upkeeps) page.

<CodeSample src="snippets/Automation/checkData.sol" />

Tips on using `checkData`:

- **Managing unbounded upkeeps**: Limit the problem set of your on-chain execution by creating a range bound for your upkeep to check and perform. This allows you to keep within predefined gas limits, which creates a predictable upper bound gas cost on your transactions. Break apart your problem into multiple upkeep registrations to limit the scope of work.

  **Example**: You could create an upkeep for each subset of addresses that you want to service. The ranges could be 0 to 49, 50 to 99, and 100 to 149.

- **Managing code paths**: Pass in data to your `checkUpkeep` to make your contract logic go down different code paths. This can be used in creative ways based on your use case needs.

  **Example**: You could support multiple types of upkeep within a single contract and pass a function selector through the `checkData` function.

#### `performData`

The response from `checkUpkeep` is passed to the `performUpkeep` function as `performData`. This allows you to perform complex and gas intensive calculations as a simulation off-chain and only pass the needed data on-chain.

You can create a highly flexible off-chain computation infrastructure that can perform precise actions on-chain by using `checkData` and `performData`. Both of these computations are entirely programmable.

### `performUpkeep` function

When `checkUpkeep` returns `upkeepNeeded == true`, the Automation node broadcasts a transaction to the blockchain to execute your `performUpkeep` function on-chain with `performData` as an input.

<Aside type="note" title="Gas limits for performUpkeep">

During registration you have to specify the maximum gas limit that we should allow your contract to use. We simulate `performUpkeep` during `checkUpkeep` and if the gas exceeds this limit the function will not execute on-chain. One method to determine your upkeep's gas limit is to simulate the `performUpkeep` function and add enough overhead to take into account increases that might happen due to changes in `performData` or on-chain data. The gas limit you specify cannot exceed the `performGasLimit` in the [configuration of the registry](/chainlink-automation/supported-networks/#configurations).

</Aside>

Ensure that your `performUpkeep` is _idempotent_. Your `performUpkeep` function should change state such that `checkUpkeep` will not return `true` for the same subset of work once said work is complete. Otherwise the Upkeep will remain eligible and result in multiple performances by the Chainlink Automation Network on the exactly same subset of work. As a best practice, always [revalidate](/chainlink-automation/compatible-contract-best-practice#revalidate-performupkeep-on-automation-compatible-contracts) conditions for your upkeep at the start of your `performUpkeep` function.

```solidity
function performUpkeep(bytes calldata performData) external override;
```

**Parameters:**

- [`performData`](#performdata-1): Data which was passed back from the `checkData` simulation. If it is encoded, it can easily be decoded into other types by calling `abi.decode`. This data should always be validated against the contract's current state.

#### `performData`

You can perform complex and broad off-chain computation, then execute on-chain state changes on a subset that meet your conditions. This can be done by passing the appropriate inputs within `performData` based on the results from your `checkUpkeep`. This pattern can greatly reduce your on-chain gas usage by narrowing the scope of work intelligently in your own Solidity code.

- **Identify a list of addresses that require work**: You might have a number of addresses that you are validating for conditions before your contract takes an action. Doing this on-chain can be expensive. Filter the list of addresses by validating the necessary conditions within your `checkUpkeep` function. Then, pass the addresses that meets the condition through the `performData` function.

  For example, if you have a "top up" contract that ensures several hundred account balances never decrease below a threshold, pass the list of accounts that meet the conditions so that the `performUpkeep` function validates and tops up only a small subset of the accounts.

- **Identify the subset of states that must be updated**: If your contract maintains complicated objects such as arrays and structs, or stores a lot of data, you should read through your storage objects within your `checkUpkeep` and run your proprietary logic to determine if they require updates or maintenance. After that is complete, you can pass the known list of objects that require updates through the `performData` function.

## Vyper example

<Aside type="note" title="Note on arrays">
  Make sure the checkdata array size is correct. Vyper does not support dynamic arrays.
