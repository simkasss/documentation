You can install and use Chainlink in your projects either manually or by using the [Chainlink Starter Kits](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/starter-kits). Once you have the Chainlink library installed, you can more easily access the Chainlink ecosystem.

<Aside type="note" title="Important">

If you're new to smart contract development and want a step-by-step guide, try out our [Getting Started](/getting-started/conceptual-overview) guide.

## Installing into existing projects

Chainlink is supported by [Hardhat](http://hardhat.org), [Brownie](https://eth-brownie.readthedocs.io/en/stable), [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com), and other frameworks.

```shell npm
npm install @chainlink/contracts --save
```

### Yarn

Install using [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/):

```shell yarn
yarn add @chainlink/contracts
